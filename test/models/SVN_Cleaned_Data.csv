6,2273363,"Probably one of the greater Sunday afternoons I have spent here in Bangkok -  the temple is new -  and ( thankfully) not very busy because of the C-19 closed border situation -

The tiles are new, the gold plated, the mirrors sparkling, the  mosaic dazzling - any influencer's personal dream  -  Also a very unusual design for a temple. 

Slightly off the beaten track but still in the midst of  it all, about a 15 minute walk from Wat Pho in the direction of the Golden Mount -  
The nearest MRT station is Sam Yot or  MRT Sanam Chai  depending on your goals to visit.

Wat Paknam and Wat Paknam on the Bang Luang River are names that began to appear in historical records in the late 18th century. Paknam means ""lock in canal"" and refers to the location of the temple. Later, it was practically abandoned and interest in it declined. In the first half of the 20th century, it was thoroughly renovated and became widely known. This is a great merit of the abbot - it was Luang Pu Sodh. From a temple with only thirteen monks, he turned it into a thriving center of education and practice. The place is now famous for promoting Dhammakaya meditation, and monks and lay teachers are engaged in it. Activities also include charitable causes such as educational, construction and many other projects.

51,2405697,"Every visit to Bangkok for me is not just about savoring its vibrant street food, exploring the labyrinthine markets, or basking in the electric nightlife; it holds a deeper, more personal ritual. Tucked away amidst the humming cityscape is a temple that quietly beckons with a unique call to generosity – the act of coffin donation. 

This temple, a serene oasis, has become my unlikely pilgrimage site. Here, away from the skyscrapers' shadows, I participate in a tradition that honors life by supporting the journey after it. The coffin donation is a profound gesture in Thai culture, an offering of dignity and respect to those who have passed away without the means for a proper farewell.

Each trip, I find my way to the temple gates, where the metropolitan bustle gives way to a tranquil courtyard. The sign pointing to the 'Coffin donation' reaffirms my purpose. Inside, I'm greeted by walls lined with names, each representing a soul whose departure from this world was eased through the kindness of strangers. 

My contributions here are small, humble threads in the larger tapestry of communal care that this foundation weaves so diligently. But the impact, I've come to realize, is immeasurable. In Bangkok, among the temples and tuk-tuks, I've found a place where I can leave a piece of my heart, contributing to a cycle of giving that reverberates with the enduring spirit of humanity. 

This tradition has become an anchor of my Bangkok experiences, a meaningful counterpoint to the ephemeral joys of travel. It reminds me that amidst the transitory nature of life, there are enduring acts of kindness that define our existence. And so, with each visit, I embrace the poignant beauty of this city, not only through its sights and sounds but through the silent giving that echoes in its heart.

Please note:
1) Write your name on the pink slip of paper to be pasted on the coffin of your choice
2) Receipt is to be burnt at the temple connecting the donation centre after you make your wishes, do not bring it back

Climb the stairs or ride the escalator?

The temple is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the city of Chiang Mai and situated at an elevation of 1,073 meters.

Theravada ‘School of the Elders' is the most commonly accepted name of Buddhism's oldest existing school.

So, you are basically visiting a historic site and national monument.

193,4773504,"At the outset, it must be noted that Wat Phra Dhammakaya Temple ""is not a tourist attraction,"" as we were reminded on our visit.  That said, the place is astonishing in many aspects and visitors interested in learning more about the temple and Dhammakaya meditation are warmly welcomed.  We tried to call in advance for information, but no one answered the phone, despite repeated calls... strange.

At the left as one enters the main compound, there is an information station that will register visitors and arrange for tours (which reportedly can also be booked in advance online).  A transport will then be arranged to take visitors to a welcome center, where an introduction to the temple is provided.  Visitors on tours are required to be dressed entirely in white, and if necessary are provided white pull-over pants and shirt at no charge.  Free tours of differing lengths can be provided, with English tours of 90, 120 or 180 minutes available.  The day we went, we were the only ones on the tour at the time we were there.

A golf-cart type vehicle took us around the massive compound (more than 300 hectares, with some 150 buildings) to see many of the structures and we were given some of the history of the Dhammakaya story.  The temple is reputed to be the largest in the world. The main feature of the compound is the Maha Dhammakaya Cetiya -- the huge UFO-like dome-shaped stupa, adorned with 300,000 small, gold-colored Buddha statues placed on the outside of the structure and another 700,000 inside (we were not taken inside the stupa).  

Surrounding the cetiya is the ""Meditation Square"" -- an open paved plaza that can reportedly accommodate 400,000 people.  Further surrounding the square is the Grand Meditation Stadium,"" which is a massive austere two-level structure a kilometer on each side, that can seat 600,000 people.  At 5:30 p.m. each evening, there is a ""lighting ceremony"" after which the main cetiya is brilliantly lighted, giving it a glowing golden appearance.  Well worth seeing.

The Dhammakaya movement is shrouded in controversy, which is beyond the scope of this review.  Suffice it to say, the controversies result in some evident underlying tensions that exist in the form of tight security in some areas of the compound and subtle defensiveness of staff when discussing some topics.  The penchant of the movement for strict discipline has led some to make comparisons to Nazism, a point that is brought further to focus when people are bizarrely informed that the main cetiya and other structures in the compound have been ""built to last at least 1,000 years"" (echoes of claims of the durability of the Third Reich?). 

We were not unduly pressured to give donations although donation boxes were conspicuous in many places throughout the compound and we were informed that merit is constantly running out (akin to water flowing out from a leaky pail) and needs to be constantly replenished (presumably, most readily through generous donations).  Quite dubiously, we were given a plain envelope at the end of our tour and urged to put a donation in the envelope that would then reportedly be given to the temple ""in the name of the international centre staff"".  Seemed particularly odd.  

Throughout our tour, our photos were taken at several locations (we were given the opportunity to deny their use in the temple's social media at the start of the tour) and the tour guides repeatedly said that copies of the photos would be emailed to us.  Unfortunately, more than two weeks after our visit, and after several reminders, we still have not received the photos.

If you don't want to join one of the tours, it's also possible to enter the compound with your own car or taxi and proceed to the Maha Dhammakaya Cetiya and the Meditation Square.  Many visitors, in fact, go there everyday in the evening and walk around the cetiya (one round takes about 15 minutes).  Visitors on their own are encouraged to wear white, but are not required to do so and many do not.

Overall, this is a very interesting place, steeped in mystery and intrigue, as well as highly impressive from architectural, religious, and meditative perspectives.  Obviously, anyone interested in learning more about the Dhammakaya method of meditation will find it particularly relevant to visit.",4,outset must noted wat phra dhammakaya temple tourist attraction reminded visit said place astonishing many aspect visitor interested learning temple dhammakaya meditation warmly welcomed tried call advance information one answered phone despite repeated call strange left one enters main compound information station register visitor arrange tour reportedly also booked advance online transport arranged take visitor welcome center introduction temple provided visitor tour required dressed entirely white necessary provided white pullover pant shirt charge free tour differing length provided english tour minute available day went one tour time golfcart type vehicle took u around massive compound hectare building see many structure given history dhammakaya story temple reputed largest world main feature compound maha dhammakaya cetiya huge ufolike domeshaped stupa adorned small goldcolored buddha statue placed outside structure another inside taken inside stupa surrounding cetiya meditation square open paved plaza reportedly accommodate people surrounding square grand meditation stadium massive austere twolevel structure kilometer side seat people pm evening lighting ceremony main cetiya brilliantly lighted giving glowing golden appearance well worth seeing dhammakaya movement shrouded controversy beyond scope review suffice say controversy result evident underlying tension exist form tight security area compound subtle defensiveness staff discussing topic penchant movement strict discipline led make comparison nazism point brought focus people bizarrely informed main cetiya structure compound built last least year echo claim durability third reich unduly pressured give donation although donation box conspicuous many place throughout compound informed merit constantly running akin water flowing leaky pail need constantly replenished presumably readily generous donation quite dubiously given plain envelope end tour urged put donation envelope would reportedly given temple name international centre staff seemed particularly odd throughout tour photo taken several location given opportunity deny use temple social medium start tour tour guide repeatedly said copy photo would emailed u unfortunately two week visit several reminder still received photo dont want join one tour also possible enter compound car taxi proceed maha dhammakaya cetiya meditation square many visitor fact go everyday evening walk around cetiya one round take minute visitor encouraged wear white required many overall interesting place steeped mystery intrigue well highly impressive architectural religious meditative perspective obviously anyone interested learning dhammakaya method meditation find particularly relevant visit

However, the entire pagoda collapsed after several days of heavy rainstorm in August 1975. Thus, the Thai public subsequently made considerable donations to rebuild the pagoda (which took four years to complete) to its original splendor, as we see today. There are several more structures on the temple complex, including an ordination hall and a number of Buddha statues.

209,8078161,"I had done a lot of research before going to this temple to get a blessed sak yant tattoo by one of the monks, expecially by Luang Pi Nunn.  I had previously gotten a sak yant tattoo by an ajarn in Chiang Mai.  My friends and I hired a taxi driver from our hotel for 1000 bahts roundtrip from Bangkok.  We left Bangkok at 7:00 am and arrived about an hour later.  Upon arriving, our driver asked someone at the temple where to get the offering, which building to go, etc.  There were a couple of different tables that sold offerings, one charged 75 bahts and another one charged 60 bahts.  After that, we were led to sit on a stone bench where there were 4 women waiting before us.  Interestingly enough, one of them spoke very good English and told us that we were at the right place.  About 15 minutes later, we were led upstairs to a building.  Right away, I felt something was wrong because I read from other posts that upstairs are for foreigners to pay large sums of money to get a sak yant tattoo.  Sure enough, once we were led upstairs, we were given a menu with all the different sak yant tattoos that they offered.  We were then told that the tattoo fee started at 4500 bahts and up depending on the pattern that we choose.  Well, I knew right then and there that we were led up to the wrong room.  After asking a couple of questions, we were told that there is another building where the monk does the tattoos.  Right away, the English speaking lady who were there before us tried to convince us that where we were was a better option because there was no wait.  But that's not the reason why we went to this temple.  So, I went downstairs to the other building to investigate.  Sure enough, Luang Pi Nunn, was in the middle of giving a tattoo to someone with about 5 people waiting.  After what I saw, I immediately went back to the other building to retrieve my friends.  As we left the upstairs room, the 2 ladies (one who spoke good English) followed us downstairs.  I thought, ok, may be they are coming to the other building with us.  Well, they left and was nowhere to be found.  A few days later, I thought about the event and I realized the English speaking lady must be part of a scam at the temple to bring unsuspecting foreigners upstairs to pay for the very expensive tattoo.  

Now that story is out of the way, let me tell you the steps.  Once arrived at the temple, find the tables that sold the offerings.  Then find the right building where the monk performs the sak yant tattoos.  The room is located on the ground floor of a building.  So, if you were led up a bunch of steps, run the other way unless you want to choose your sak yant and pay an arm and a leg for it.  Once you find the right room, you need to make a 25 bahts donation on silver platter in the middle of the floor.  You will also put the offering you bought on that platter.  Then you will find a stack of pink envelopes (very worn because they are reused).  You'll then put a donation into that pink envelope, find a place to sit on the floor and wait for your turn to get tattooed by the monk.  The rest you can just watch and learn while you wait for your turn.  It is important to remember that the monk determines which sak yant and its location on your body.  There is no pictures allowed inside the building and please be respectful to the process.  The tattoos that we received were done with a tattoo gun.

Anyway the Thais seem to love it all and come to do their reverential ritual acts, buy lottery tickets and eat and drink. It's all kind of a Thai Buddhist day out. 
The sculpture work and the casting of the Buddha in a ceramic looking statue were impressive enough but it seems rather secular to me and the garish lighting reminds me of Chinese caves.  But maybe entertainment, laughter and colour are the way Thais approach their Buddhist way of life.

226,12641647,"Let’s start with the drawbacks of this place - since they try to be as welcoming and. hosting as possible, they accept everything, every time without the option to register in advance. I guess this is the way a monastery should be, but reality it makes a very crowded meditation center, with few private kutis, so a lot of people are squeezed in each communal kuti. Although the kutis are very convenient and each floor has its own 2 private bathroom and showers, and each one has ceiling fans, the more people squeezed in a kuti, the harder it gets to sleep and meditate. 

This place is very welcoming to foreigners and beginners, and so the atmosphere is not strict. They allow you to choose whether to keep silent or not and they allow using phones as long as it is both in silent areas. They are very soft in the discipline, which requires the meditators to be in self discipline. I would say, this works for locals, but less with foreigners who are not used to worshipping idols, minding the surrounding of the others etc. 

Foreigners have to understand that this is mainly a monastery of Thai culture, and so they require women to sit at the back in the meditation hall. This is the buddhist Thai culture, and foreigners must accept it, otherwise they will just feel frustration. 

To me it was the first meditation center experience, and it was good, however due to the overcrowding of the place, I couldn’t find enough peace of mind to meditate so I had to leave ealier than planned. It was also a good place for me to learn the local culture of the Thai people.",4,let start drawback place since try welcoming hosting possible accept everything every time without option register advance guess way monastery reality make crowded meditation center private kutis lot people squeezed communal kuti although kutis convenient floor private bathroom shower one ceiling fan people squeezed kuti harder get sleep meditate place welcoming foreigner beginner atmosphere strict allow choose whether keep silent allow using phone long silent area soft discipline requires meditators self discipline would say work local less foreigner used worshipping idol minding surrounding others etc foreigner understand mainly monastery thai culture require woman sit back meditation hall buddhist thai culture foreigner must accept otherwise feel frustration first meditation center experience good however due overcrowding place couldnt find enough peace mind meditate leave ealier planned also good place learn local culture thai people

She was temporally taken to Wat Ku until she could be brought to Bangkok for a Royal funeral.   The boats involved in the mishap were later recovered and taken to Wat Ku and are currently on display next to a large reclining Buddha.  My first visit was in 2009.  A larger wooden temple stood in front of a smaller modern one . The wooden structure was very old and constructed in the Mon style architecture.  The Wat's grounds were wide and open.  Taxies and cars would often cut across them to get to the river.  WOW! things have changed.  As we drove around the curve This magnificent structure appeared surrounded by a smoothed masonry wall with gleaming stainless steel inserts.  My wife advised me there was an attempt to raise the old wooden structure because of the water damage through the annual rainy seasons but it failed and partly collapsed, making it a complete total loss.   The new Wat is a white building trimmed in gold, very ornate, built in the Thai style, except for the reddish brown tile roof, instead of the traditional orange ones. Inside is breath taking.  There are several new buildings including a huge structure.  I remember the foundation being laid in 2009 and it's still under construction.  But, sadly with all of the new construction, the patio area with the reclining Buddha and Royal boats, have fallen into disrepair.

268,2660351,"This temple is dedicated to Chamathewi, the Mon princess from Lawo, today’s Lopburi, who founded Haripunchai, now called Lamphun, in the late 9th century.  About 1.5 km west of Wat Haripunchai, its most notable feature is the pair of old brick chedis first built in the early 12th century.  The originals collapsed in an earthquake, were rebuilt in1218 and are in rather good condition today.  The larger one, behind the viharn, Chedi Suwan Chang Kot, is a stepped pyramid on a square base, 21 meters high, of brick and stucco.  Each side of its five tiers features three sculptures of standing Buddhas, making 60 altogether.
       Around the corner of the modern temple building is Chedi Ratana.  Similar in style, but on a hexagonal base and only 11.5 meters high, it has standing Buddha sculptures only in the niches on the bottom level.  However, according to popular belief, Chedi Ratana contains the ashes of Queen Chamathewi.  Together, these two chedis are rare and outstanding examples of ancient Mon architecture in Thailand.
       Inside the viharn next to them are many wall murals depicting events in the life of Chamathewi:  her arrival by boat, establishing herself in the city, fighting off enemies, etc.  A small shrine near the entrance of the compound contains a standing image of the ancient queen.",5,temple dedicated chamathewi mon princess lawo today lopburi founded haripunchai called lamphun late th century km west wat haripunchai notable feature pair old brick chedis first built early th century original collapsed earthquake rebuilt rather good condition today larger one behind viharn chedi suwan chang kot stepped pyramid square base meter high brick stucco side five tier feature three sculpture standing buddha making altogether around corner modern temple building chedi ratana similar style hexagonal base meter high standing buddha sculpture niche bottom level however according popular belief chedi ratana contains ash queen chamathewi together two chedis rare outstanding example ancient mon architecture thailand inside viharn next many wall mural depicting event life chamathewi arrival boat establishing city fighting enemy etc small shrine near entrance compound contains standing image ancient queen

270,552544,"Sited in a quiet neighborhood a couple blocks north of the Chang Puak bus station, Wat Ku Tao in recent decades has become the second temple, besides Wat Pa Pao, serving the local Shan community.  Its resident monks wear red robes, as in the Shan States in Myanmar, rather than the yellow robes of Thai monks.  Although the main viharn is in local Thai style, the Buddha image inside is of a type more common in Myanmar.  It is the Buddha as Universal Ruler, reigning over a time in the future when the Buddhist Dharma has triumphed everywhere.  He wears royal robes, a crown and lots of jewelry.  
       The unusual chedi at Wat Ku Tao was built in 1613 to enshrine the ashes of Nawrahta Minsaw, the first Burmese-born governor of conquered Lanna.  It rises in five diminishing spheres, representing five historical and future Buddhas.  The temple is particularly active on Buddhist holidays, especially for the uniquely Shan Por Sang Long in late March.

276,546141,"I actually flew all the way to Udon Thani to see this, so my expectations were high. Not sure it delivered. 

You can tell the pandemic has hit this place hard, but the park was open on a random weekday, and I was able to buy cold water and rent an umbrella (for the shade) for 10 baht.

The statues were impressive and unique. Many had a similar face, a smiling face which was sometimes serene and sometimes creepy. The works of art here are mainly concerned with Buddhism and Hinduism and show an alternate depiction of the same-old statues you see everywhere else in Thailand. In fact, they even felt critical / subversive. For that reason, I was surprised people were making offerings to some like they would at a regular Wat.

The place was a bit run down. The statues -- while amazing if a bit repetitive -- could use some upkeep. Also, Thai descriptions explained what the various scenes represented, but there was nothing in English. I may have enjoyed and understood more had I a translation. Also, the facilities were pretty rough. I used a mid-park lavatory that was practically falling apart. (Maybe there were nicer ones elsewhere?)

Overall, it was one of the most unique Wats I've visited in Thailand, but I was hoping for more care for the grounds / visitors.

(As for location, it's not too far from the Mekong river. Google Maps directed my car here, no problem. And only a handful of people were there, so parking was easy. Since the nearby border to Laos is closed I assume -- at least, not a trivial cross due to quarantine requirements -- that would be another reason the place is not seeing many people.

This outdoor park settled hundred(s) of religious sculptures. Some of them are in the size of human, while most of them are huge, and the rests are gigantic. These powerful statues representations included historical life of Buddha, Bodhisattva, Hindu deities, angels in heaven and sufferings in hell (according to Buddhism), mythical creatures from Jataka tales such as naga and garuda, characters from Hindu legend (Ramayana) and folklores. Some sculptures represent local proverbs that teach moral principles, some illustrate significant events in local literatures, while some display Buddhist beliefs such as ""Karma"" and ""Samsara"". Base of statues also have (Thai) scripts to describe their details (name, legend, date of creation), or show some doctrines, or even leave some dharma puzzles. I do respect the creator of these statues. What a faith!

Entrance fee is 20 bath for Thai and 40 baht for foreigner (double priced but still cheap). Lucky for us that the weather was mild (Unless we might be burned), so we spent whole hour leisuring around and taking photos.

284,6987966,"IMPACT Arena in Bangkok is a bit of a mixed experience. The venue itself is impressive with its large size and modern facilities. You'll notice during events that the sound quality is excellent, which is largely due to the well-thought-out interior design that helps sound engineers. Also, the air ventilation system works well, especially during crowded events, keeping things comfortable.

Seating, however, is just average. It's not exactly uncomfortable, but it can feel a bit cramped when the arena is full.

The complex has a good number of restaurants and enough restrooms. But, it falls short when it comes to an adequate waiting area outside the arena. Additionally, accessibility for guests with disabilities isn't the best, mainly because of unclear signage.

A notable downside is the transportation. The arena doesn't connect well with public transit, making it tricky to arrive and leave. Taxis are not only hard to find but often charge higher rates, and there's no organized taxi queue. The lack of nearby bus or train options means many visitors have to use private transport. However, parking is a hassle, with high fees and often heavy traffic. For big events, it might be a good idea to stay at a nearby hotel to avoid these transportation woes.

Overall, while the arena does a great job hosting events, it definitely needs to improve in terms of accessibility and transportation options.",3,impact arena bangkok bit mixed experience venue impressive large size modern facility youll notice event sound quality excellent largely due wellthoughtout interior design help sound engineer also air ventilation system work well especially crowded event keeping thing comfortable seating however average exactly uncomfortable feel bit cramped arena full complex good number restaurant enough restroom fall short come adequate waiting area outside arena additionally accessibility guest disability isnt best mainly unclear signage notable downside transportation arena doesnt connect well public transit making tricky arrive leave taxi hard find often charge higher rate there organized taxi queue lack nearby bus train option mean many visitor use private transport however parking hassle high fee often heavy traffic big event might good idea stay nearby hotel avoid transportation woe overall arena great job hosting event definitely need improve term accessibility transportation option

308,4322919,"Hi there folks  well i am in Chiang Mai sitting on the loo thin hung about my month in Thailand. 
 I had a AWSOME experience in the province of Sing Buri. (Funny i ask my wife why every town ends in Buri ) I now no it means town / city. But I'm sure you smart people out there new that 
Anyway it was the 100 day passing of my wife's grand farther. We went to Sing Buri to a family gathering. Good and alchole. Wow wow 
Those Thai boys like there Whisky 
So it was big for them getting the Farang drunk. I held my own though I don't drink a lot. 
On the Sunday morning after a big saterday night every body got up we stayed in grandfathers home were the clay water pots around the back yard were over 200 years old as was the house it was so cool sleeping there for me. 
Scattered around the yard also were old fishing boats very old. I did see traditional fisherman floating down river in these boats but that's another post 
So food was prepared in abundance to take to the monks at temple every one help including the kids. 
The experience next was so cool   We all went to temple near the house and a gathering of monks sat on the floor we placed the food in front of them on traditional trays and silver water drinking dishes. Then they chanted for a hour I think for my western ear it was Somthing I will never forget. The harmonies wow wow wow that's all I can say 
Then they ate Wat they could. Then the children gathered the remaining food and placed it in front of every one else  I was instructed to eat. The food is considered blessed as the monks have touched it. And because they are full from eating this fullness is passed on to grandfather for a safe journey to the next life. 
I was humbled i became emotional i also was getting watched by every one as they had never had a Farang take part in a ceromony like this in that temple. I'm sure others have experienced this though. I felt so lucky. 
It was like a initiation for me into the family. 
Then back to the house for more Whisky. I was lucky my wife dragged me away from her brothers and we went and checked out some of the other Temples in Sing Buri. Such as the temple were the inside is all solid gold. I got to look inside. 
I'll shut up now and perhaps i can tell you guys about that another time. Got to get of the loo now

320,4322812,"There were many food stalls selling the typical thai food but also, some stalls selling snacks which are rare to find in Bangkok. ( I have attached some photos for reference). Only available during weekends.

You can rent a bicycle or walk to go around this small island. In my opinion, it is better to walk than cycle, because the pathways are actually quite narrow. Also, you can take in the sights much better as the stalls are located next to one another. The pathway is actually the circumference around the island. That being said, only a section of the entire pathway is taken up by the food stalls, hence, the remaining parts of the pathway are actually better to be explored if you have some form of transport. There are motorbike taxis at certain points of the pathway, such as where the markets end, where you will not see any crowd beyond. The motorbike taxi can take you through for 50 THB.

To get here, I went to Victory Monument BTS station, and walked to the bus stop that has bus 166. Just tell the ticket conductor you want to go to ""Pak kret"". The journey took about 1 hour and costs 22 THB. Alight at the stop before the U turn. Then, walk ahead and turn left to Wat Bo temple. Walk through Wat Bo temple and exit through the back.

323,4322812,"Was meant to do a tour which got cancelled so i decided to go on my own. I was lucky enough to find info on a blog that said theres a 10am boat on a Sunday (Chao Praya Express) that will go directly to Koh Kret from Sathorn Pier. Took a train and stopped at BTS Saphan Taksin station and its a five minute walk to the pier. I bought a round trip ticket for 180baht. 

It was a pleasant journey that took about an hour. You get to the island and you are left to your own devices. There was a small weekend market selling food, I just kept walking. I was told later it was best to walk around the island clockwise, but i went anti-clockwise. I had no particular itinerary, so i just kept walking. I did stop at a small photo studio to get my portrait one as a souvenir for 30 baht(he said it was a weekend special, usual price was 50). i happened upon a pottery factory/shop and got some beautiful tealight holders which they will safely wrap for you to bring home. i was there by lunch time but most of the riverside cafe/restaurants were filled, so i kept walking. 

You will pass little houses on stilts and nature. its a very nice village and nice to see the way of life of the people who live there. i hald walked 1/4 way in the path and was about to regret not stopping for food but I somehow found Rongsi Studio which also had Milli cafe which is housed in a 100 yr old former mill. Had my lunch there before continuing my journey. 

The whole walk is about 6km. Just do not stray off the main path if you do not have enough time. I got stopped twice by motorcycle taxis offering to take me around but i declined cos i was perfectly fine walking under the hot sun (yes, really). One thought I was crazy. Its a pleasant walk. times when you are alone and its very peaceful. I was on the island for about 4 hours. I was lucky to reach back at the pier by 3.45(they said boat leaves at 4pm), but i was apparently the last one and we then left for bangkok. I was able to get off at ICONSIAM. 

Things to note- 
-I was there on a Sunday (during covid times) so it wasnt as crowded as I thought it would be.
- most of the signs are in Thai, it was mostly Thai tourists. 
- there are various temples on the island,  but i did not visit any of them. 
- if you dont like walking, you can rent a bicycle but be careful and not be a wobbly cyclists as some parts of the path have to rails/barrier so you may just fall into the water.

336,7378165,"""MORE STUFF""? YEAH, I ALREADY HAVE THE ORIGINAL ""STUFF"" ON TRIPADVISOR'S KO MU ANG THONG PAGE (there are 2 for some reason - the one with more reviews).

KO MAE KOH is the island in ANG THONG NATIONAL PARK with the GREEN LAGOON/LAKE made famous by the novel “THE BEACH.” Admittedly they later shot the movie way across at PHI PHI LEY in the ANDAMAN SEA – largely because the beach there fitted more closely the description in the novel: KO MAE KO’s main beach although nice is small.
Note however KO MAE KOH is not ANG THONG’s main island – that is the headquarters island KO WUA TALAP. This has the even better known climbs to THE HIGH VIEWPOINT and LOTUS CAVE. The good thing is that most daytrip  itineraries make a point of calling in at both islands – if not, pick another trip provider - the 2 main islands are dead set highlights. (in my research, one outfit out of KO PHANGAN substitutes a SNORKELING STOP for one of the 2 main islands. Shallow water and closeness to some big mainland rivers means water clarity isn’t great for coral or snorkeling). 
Most visitors to the island come in on one of the daytrip boats out of KOS SAMUI or PHANGAN ((last I heard you can’t get daytrips from KO TAO or the MAINLAND but there are some charters and an occasional sailing cruise from the former). 
Because there are other spots in the marine park to visit, each MAE KO stay over tends to last 90 to 120minutes. This gives plenty of time to climb to the GREEN LAGOON/LAKE viewpoint and laze on the beach afterwards.

THE CLIMB – when I first visited in the ‘90s there was a rough somewhat circuitous and longer climb to the lagoon. This has been replaced by a much shorter wooden stairway leaving from the corner of the beach – it’s in very  good  condition suggesting it is only a few years old. This is one steep climb – I reckon a lot is abt 45degrees. Fortunately the climb is short (a sign said 150m but I reckon that was the height of the platform – the actual length was more like 300m which is still pretty short) and there are plenty of resting platforms on the way up so even unfit people should make it with a few stops. The view at top is a 2 way panorama of THE LAGOON in one direction and surrounding islands in the other:  well worth the effort.
On the way down, something new from my 90s visit – a branch in the stairway leads down to a platform not far above the lagoon’s green surface (colour comes from the limestone). Swimming is forbidden in the lagoon.

THE BEACH – once the climb is done, visitors spend some time on the beach. This is very compact – only about 60m long but has plenty of sand even at full tide. There is a pretty big swimming enclosure which keeps swimmers away from longtail boats shuttling people from the floating blue plastic pier near the foot of the stairway to the daytrip boats offshore.
I grabbed a dive mask and checked the underwater scene in the deeper part of the enclosure – not great: ANG THONG’s close to some big mainland rivers and in the shallow Gulf so water clarity isn’t fantastic. Coral likes clarity. But I’m an elitist- non-fanatical snorkelers won’t find the underwater scene boring. 
There must have been 20 daytrip boats (evenly split between largish slowboats and speedboats) offshore and the small beach got pretty crowded. A national park canteen behind the sand was doing good business. There is an amenities block nearby. 
There were also a lot of kayaks drawn up on the beach – many slowboats  carry kayaks, and passengers have an option of paddling from a nearby island across to MAE KOH. However unlike the beach at NATIONAL PARK HQ ISLAND (KO WUA TALAP), I don’t think NP hires kayaks here.

The island is not very far from Bangkok, so getting there doesn't take very long. The Royal Thai Navy is in charge of Ko Samae San. Visitors are only permitted on day trips and may not spend the night. They can, however, stay at the hotels close to the dock. One of the nine islands in the Plant Genetic Conservation Project, which is a part of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn's royal initiative, is Ko Samae San. The project's goals are to promote the island as a location for learning and responsible travel. The island may be explored via glass-bottom boat rides, kayaking, biking, and snorkeling. There are amenities available, including snorkeling gear, life jackets, restrooms, showers, and dining options. Even though Ko Samae San has five beaches, only two of them—Hat Thien and Hat Luk Lom—allow people to swim. Effective protection has led to the breathtaking views of white beaches, crystal-clear seas, and stunning coral reefs. Every day and in every season, tourists are welcome at Ko Samae San. However, there is a daily visiting cap of 500 people. There are no advance tickets available; therefore, guests must purchase their tickets at the Natural History Museum's reception desk at Khao Mar Jor Pier (9 a.m.–5 p.m.).

On the island, we did snorkeling - 50 Baht for 30 mins, kayaking - 100 Baht per hour, 15 mins ride on glass bottom boat to see the corel under - 20 Baht, and just enjoy the beach and crystal clear water. Easy lunch (run our fast), instant noodle, snacks and drinks are available on the island. Shades and caKids really love the island.

I was expecting over 1000 steps, but this was not the case. This Tiger Cave Temple is about a 30 minute drive from the River Kwai Bridge. There are very steep steps to the top, but they number only about 150. There is another walk up to the right, where the steps are not quite as steep. Alternatively, there is a paid trolley you can take to the top, although it was not working the day we attended. 
Certainly this temple is worth a visit. The steps are manageable (even in heat) and give way to beautiful views over the rice fields as well as the stunning architecture of the temple itself. There is a small shop at the top for drinks or souvenirs, there are also toilets at the ascent. (Many more shops are on the roadside opposite the car park)
We went in the morning and it was moderately busy, but most larger tour groups seemed to be arriving as we were leaving.

Images carved into the rocks were both life size and bigger and the details were amazing. This place really made me appreciate the skills of many of the workers.

440,4681001,"I hope everyone considering attending the 10-day silence Meditation Course at sun Mokh will find this review helpful of my recent experience. 

Positive Side: 
- Beautiful compound, very peaceful with lots of old wonderful trees, three ponds and nice walkways for walking meditation
- They are really strict with the rules so you can focus on your silent during the whole time
- Food is absolutely delicious, traditional Thai Food and even quite spicy (which I loved in my case),  sometimes even desserts, fruits and first and last day some hot chocolate as well
- Good itinerary for beginner with a mix between sitting and walking meditation and very long (super basic) Yoga in the morning which is really helpful to feel more comfortable in the sitting position
- Hot springs were amazing. Although you were only able to use them after breakfast and evening tea

Downside: 
- This beautiful centre would benefit so much from a passionate, kind-hearted person who runs this retreat who's got a background knowing western mindsets and speaks excellent English. This was somehow lacking and this experience stands and falls also with the teachers in my opinion
- Don't come here if you want to go really deep into meditation (there's chanting and some talking) or if you really want to learn about Buddhism (lack of good teachers that make the philosophy relatable)
- Super basic accommodation. Be prepared to sleep on a concrete. bed and wooden pillow, lots of insects, small animals, scorpions, snakes around a.s.o. washing is in washing
-The hour chanting Pali Texts with the monk wasn't helpful at all as we constantly had to translate and therefore you can't. really go deep into the chanting /meditation through chanting, so you don't learn or gain anything in my opinion
-Day 9 came only announced one day before - there's only one meal a day and that's at. 08.30 h in the morning. So, that day is super long. And after that it feels like you're kind off ready to leave and there's still another full day with the usual program, which doesn't make lots of sense. 
-It would be great to offer a Q&A sometime in the middle or offer some sort of support, just in general the whole experienced lacked some of. the loving kindness / compassion I know. from Buddhist centers otherwise. 

What you should. bring: 
- Sleeping bag (silk. inlet), comfortable. pillow and soft mattress (unless you really want the concrete bed experience)
- Mosquito spray and something for itches of the mosquito bites (the most horrible thing in the summer months, they drive you mad...), coconut oil for the small little flies
- Towel and toilet paper, all kind off toiletries (soaps, shampoos), pharmacy articles - there's only. tiny shops otherwise. you're on your own. 
-For women: Bring a sarong to use the ""shower"" and the hot springs, you need to cover up all the time
-Loose, light clothes that cover upper arms/shoulds and at least the knees, shawl, longer light jacket for the evening to cover from mosquitos
-Torch for early mornings and late evenings
-Yoga Mat (if you have your own) and clothes for Yoga
-Water drinking bottle (there's filtered water to fill up)
-Maybe some nuts of something in case you get really hungry at the beginning and your body hasn't adjusted to the light diet yet, no fresh food though, too many insects)
- plastic bag to have a trash in your room
-Washing detergent for your clothes (you do your own laundry)
-If you have- meditation cushion that you like

You can keep your diary and books, no one will control this and I found it very helpful to write down dreams and insights during the retreat, but. in general in Vipassana it's not advised to write or read anything, so that depends on your. taste. 

All in all I've found it an incredible experience, I gained wonderful insights and I would consider doing it again, but not at the same place. It was super quiet in July with only around 24 participants, in the winter it will be more crowded during high season.

The small shop for mosquito repellent etc is very helpful. 

Besides that:
It is focused on beginner level and not for advanced meditators with a lot of walking meditation to make it easier for everyone. Still, don’t expect too much detailed insights on the specific steps but more generic guidance with a lot of buddhism-related introductions
Its quite noisy. Morning talk, dhamma talk, food reflection, chanting, yoga / relaxation instructions are a lot for a silent retreat and disturb the calming mind. Due to the constant change between sitting and walking meditation there is also a lot of movement. Bring earplugs
Instead of yoga mats there are straw mats (more dangerous than helpful), instead of sleeping mats there are „wooden mats“ and „wooden pillows“ (strange thinking that softer mats for participants are luxurious while for coordinators/staff they are ok) and the meditation cushions have seen much better days. Bring your own stuff
Yoga instructions are focused on the course coordinator and his needs - you more or less follow that. Yoga was 105 minutes a day.
Day 10 was really a lost day due to how the program was set up with day 9 as the „marathon“ meditation day

Really not working:
The surprising „working meditation“ on day 10 is a terrible idea! We were expected to shovel sand for a new Wat Suan Mokh building that is even outside of the retreat areal. They probably just wanted to save some money and used us to do the work. This was announced on the afternoon itself and communicated as a meditation exercise and not as a humble request. So much for the noble spirit

459,10533364,"Chao Pho Khao Yai Shrine is a Chinese-style Buddhist temple built into the side of the cliff at the northern end of Ko Sichang Harbour.  

It was built by 18th century Chinese traders to protect them while at sea and to ensure a safe passage home.

The shrine dominates the northern skyline of Ko Sichang Harbour, and sticks out as a prominent red building halfway up the mountain at the northern end of the harbor.

The shrine itself is accessed by a steep flight of stairs, although there is now a cable car for those less fit (with appropriate donation box on arrival).  We walked up.

The décor is typically Chinese.  Very colourful and apart from Buddha, the shrine includes the whole pantheon of Chinese gods.

As it is built into the side of the cliff, there are many small grotto-like shrines, each dedicated to a particular deity.  But watch your head, as the entrances to some are very low and you can do yourself a nasty injury on the low hanging rocks.

Apart from the shrine itself, the view from the top is breathtaking.

500,7624472,"I play with a group of expats who play weekly at a different course.  We rent a communal luxury van and leave from Sukhemvit, Soi 8.  We made it to the golf course in 35 minutes, a record for our group traveling from one of the tourist centers of Bangkok.  

Check in was smooth.  There pro shop was staffed and adequately stocked with new items and, for a hacker like me, some very clean and locally packaged gently used golf balls.  The green, cart and caddie fee was TB1600.  They take only Thai Baht. 

The men's locker room is clean, newer, air conditioned and spacious.   

The starter did not take control.  We were very early and could have started our game early.  When we saw other players approaching, we went to T-off and then were stopped.  He was seriously complacent.  Well, we eventually T'd off and played golf!

The fareways are wide and seeded with a local Thai grass.  The grounds crew were cutting this day and the fairway was littered with excess cut grass.  It had rained the night before and the roll of the course limited.  Yes, we had to manage the course!  

There is water to be aware of.  Sometimes the water is on a side, other times hidden over a small rise in the fairway and  the last green is surrounded by water.  Our caddies knew the course and did tell us the distances to the water traps in broken English. 

This is a very good local course located just north of Don Muenge Airport.  I recommend golfers and hackers alike to include it in a self administered Thai golf vacation.

There were a lot of waves today, which made the suply of new rubbish extra large. The water was therefore also very cloudy and not clear as we had seen in the pictures. So if you want to visit this place, I would advise you to check in advance whether there are few waves and whether the beach has been cleaned. As it was today, I would advise against visiting it.

Apart from the garbage problem, I would say it was a very nice beach for children, as it was not too deep and the sand is fine-grained.

521,4126351,"Went to this temple in November and to be honest I didn't know what to expect as a friend to me as a surprise!!
10 baht to get in was odd i initially  thought and I also  couldn't see any monks either. 
What a weird place.
Obviously this temple is meant to shock and indeed frighten people into believing if you do bad things in life there will be a price to pay.
Some brutal and scary figures are strewn across the temple as well as some sexually explicit figures which once you get over the initial shock are sort of thought provoking.
Sound affects are included with some of the scarier figures but incur a charge of 10 baht fee...only 10 baht coins can be used folks...quite a few Thai school children were there at the same time and oddly enough were left to walk/run/play around the temple unsupervised by their teachers...many of them were terrified at what they saw judging by the expressions on their faces.
I speak thai so was able to explain to them that what they were looking at wasn't real and that ghosts and demons do not exist.
Odd temple...but worth a visit as it is a culture shock especially when you consider Thailand is a pretty conservative country in so many ways.
So visit this place but bring lots of 10 baht coins with you to get the full affects of this temple/amusement park.

523,4126351,"A half hour ride from central Chiang Mai and 3 km east of Mae Jo University, Wat Mae Kaet Noi is famous for its Hell Garden to the left of the viharn.  Created from the visions of the abbot, known as Clean Teacher Monk, the park is an exhibit of what happens to people in the afterlife, particularly the gruesome tortures they will endure for various sins.  A Dante-like theme of the punishment fitting the crime informs most of the sculptures, easy to figure out even if you can’t read the Thai language explanation signs.  Sculptures depicting the tortures for sexual offenses, in a kind of porno-horro-graphic style are the most striking, along with the large section on abortion.
       A ten baht coin gets you inside.  Besides the torture scenes, skewered torsos and bodies trapped in the earth, very tall demons stand along the paths.  At some spots you can drop a ten baht coin into a machine and listen to the screams of sinners and the ranting of demons.  Even without the sound effects it’s a pretty disturbing place.
       A small section of the garden is devoted to Heaven, with statues of Buddha, monks and saints, devotees at prayer and a very unusual ‘children tree’ with young boys and girls sprouting from the vines.   This year the temple added a new exhibit, of rural life in pre-electricity days, in the area on the other side of the hall to the right of the viharn.  The statues are of tattooed farmers, kick-boxers, cheroot-smokers, preening women and meditating monks.

The grounds are lovely, the whole place bears spending some time in reflection and meditation.  Not far from the Amari Buriram Hotel, where I was always stay. but will be hard to get to without your own wheels. 
I highly recommend using a local driver I use when I'm in Buriram, Khun Oi.
She's an excellent driver, knows the area well, has great english. Khun Oi is a lovely tour guide, driver and negotiator.
Booking a trip to Wat Khao Noi (which Khun Oi turned me onto) can be combined to a trip to Huai Chorakhe Mak,  
Huai Chorakhe Mak is a lovely wildlife preserve built on two lakes. They're are bridged by a lovely long walkway along the water front, simply spectacular. There's a lovely path that rings the lakes and you can rent bikes there and do the route easily on a bike. I just love this place and visit each time I'm in Buriram.

This is probably the hardest hike we have made to a viewpoint/temple to date, unsure if this is because we are getting older, got unfit due to the crazy quarantine rules daring COVID or possibly as we started the trek at 14.30pm when the sun is searing hot...
The steps start small but then get higher nearer the top, which adds to the difficulty, shops all along the trek so you will never be short of a drink or shade and a rest area.
When (if) you make it to the top, the temple is quite basic  so if you are looking for a more beautiful temple then go to the golden buddah one at the start...
We masterd this one in 1hr 40minutes but really pushed ourselves, others we spoke to took 3hrs to get to the top which gives a rough idea of what to expect.

558,17642639,"I got talking to a girl in Devil's Playground (Suzie Wong II?) and she told me that the Suzie Wong organisation now controls about seven clubs in that area of Patong and I believe they are all operating on the same model. That being a girl sits with you, you buy her a 'lady drink' which is inevitably a TINY shot of Tequila for 250 Baht which she drinks quite quickly after which she looks at you expecting you to buy her another one. (The bottle of local beer I had cost (I think) 140 or 150 Baht). I also went to Harem and in there one girl was pushing me to buy her two drinks at once!) In exchange for this she may or may not sit or stand close to you and may or may not encourage you to put your hands on her. It could therefore be said to be an outrageous rip off but . . . we all know that right?

The girl in Devil's Playground also told me that the standard bar fine in these clubs is 2,000 Baht. The girls in these places are of a very high standard and the music in Harem and Devil's Playground is usually cool dance music. I don't go in Suzy Wong's because I don't like watching women trying to grind to rock music. But of course whether you have a good time or not all depends on the girl. If she's into you then you probably will but if she isn't then you won't. The problem some guys find with the relatively 'upmarket' places where the more attractive girls work is that they often exercise their right to say no. Sneaky attempts to gouge as much money from the customer as possible may be precede this brush off. Don't be surprised by this. Instead take a look in the mirror and ask why you've been blown out.

I've given three stars because the girls are usually hot, the staff are friendly, the venues are ok and the music is often very good.

562,17642639,"I am rating this club 3 out of 5 based on my 4 visits on 4 consecutive & last days of my Thailand trip but actually it deserves it 5 out of 5 however there are few but very important things spoil the ratings of your club & I am rating only 3.
I would like to start with the positives first. Girls are mostly beautiful. Bar tenders, servers all are polite & did their jobs fairly well on all my 4 visits.. Music & space, sofas seating space was good. Drinks were fairly priced & good. Having said all this I would have rated it 5 out of 5 as I still consider it as one of the best bar not only in phuket but in Thailand however on my last 2 visits there were things occurred which spoiled the rating from 5 to 3.

Girl NADIA - On my 2nd visit I spotted her & I liked her very much so I asked her for drink with me but seems she was busy with other customers which I understood so while leaving I asked her if she can have a drink with me tomorrow on which she quickly agreed. I asked her twice & she agreed on both occasion that she will have drink with me tomorrow. I visited early next day & I saw her. So I asked her for a drink for which she did not even respond at all!! This was upsetting . I asked little later again but she did not even respond!! I felt disrespected not because she did not honor her own words but she did not even bother to pay any attention & say no to me.. I can accept no but what is this? Not even honoring your own words taking which the customer revisited your club.. If you don't want to drink then say at least no respectfully specially when your yourself said yes yesterday to have a drink today.. Say NO that is your right but at least respond with respect instead of ignoring the customer's request & making ugly & rude gestures . 

Even after this incident I would have rated the club at least 4 out of 5 by ignoring the incident with NADIA but similar but even worst incident occurred later days on my 3rd & 4th visit..
On my 3rd visit  I liked one girl very much her name was similar to the first one but I think it spells out little differently Nadee Or Nadeen Or Naadeen. Please check you would know.. She is tall & black open hair . I asked her for a drink with me & she came for a drink. I liked her so I asked her if she can come out with me for 1 hour she asked for 6000 & 2000 bar fine and I convinced her for 5000  & 2000 bar fine but I requested her for an appointment next day as I was very tired as I was travelling whole day & it was already 2 am. She gave me appointment time next day after mid night and we had & agreement. I bought her 3 lady drinks on our first meet & everything went fine till here. Next day as per our agreement I came by 11pm & I found her busy with other customers so I waited for her to be free. After 30 min when she got free I approached her & asked her going with me  for 1 hour as per our agreement but she refused & stated that she needs to work on the bar so I said fine I can wait till her shift is over I. E 3 am.. She did not respond to that & said she can only drink with me in the bar but can't go out.. Her english was hard to understand so I did not get the exact reason of her U turn & not being able to honor her words.i thought she was saying lady drinks first so I ordered few lady drinks for her & again asked her multiple times but she kept on saying no.. We had drinks and lap dance for almost 30 min for which I ended up paying 3000 but she refused.. Now this is very interesting.. She kept on asking for drinks & tips & I continued paying & ordering drinks for her but when I was leaving she asked for 3000 thb one drink & said if I buy this 3000 thb one drink she will not only stay with me for some more time but will go out with me next time for free!!!!! Do you think anyone will buy this offer. You couldn't honor your words & not ready to go out for 7000 thb but you are promising the customer that on next visit you will go for free!!She was good but misleading the customers making false promises to buy lady drinks & tips!! & when the time comes for honoring your words you take U turn!!

Apparently the bar goes through different phases during the week, and I happened to end up there on a very gay night.  No matter for me as most of the patrons were very cool and tolerant of straight people.  One or two were infamous perverts though and needed to be hit with a spray bottle.

I didn't get any guff from Wong or his staff. I imagine he was too busy to hassle everyone as the bar was full and everybody was buying drinks.  Yes, he did have a flashlight pointed at your face when he talked to you and I can't work out why.

Despite the lack of sleep (from too much dancing), I didn’t skip breakfast. The selection is huge with lots of great tasting organic food. Not too be missed! 

I’m also very impressed with the housekeeping staff, with so many rooms and so many people going in and out all the time I imagine that it wasn’t easy to do their job. Yet they managed to clean the rooms very fast. 

When I got back to Bangkok I realised that I left a puzzle book in the hotel room. It’s not expensive but has sentimental value to me. I called the hotel to inform them and within an hour they called me back saying they had found it. The lady on the phone wasn’t sure if it could be delivered but I gave my address just in case.

I had already accepted the fact that I would have to drive back out there again if I wanted to reunite with my book but early on the next week I received my book in the mail! When I called to ask about payment options they said not to worry about it.

I’m very impressed with the lovely staff at this hotel.

594,6669539,"To my mind, Suan Son is the most interesting beach on Rayong Province's coastline.  

You enter the beach along a road that is an arboreal archway formed by tall Casuarina Pines growing either side of the road.  This has a beauty all of its own, especially as the sunlight filters through the leafy canopy.

At one end of the beach are many small and colourful fishing boats, pulled up on the sandy beach after a night at sea.

Just behind them, locals have set up stalls selling the catch  -  fish, crabs, many varieties of prawns, and many varieties of shellfish.  This seafood market is popular with locals because the prices are right.

Beyond that are many small cabin-type seafood restaurants with deckchairs and tables set out on the beach in front of them.  This is an ideal way to have a relaxing seafood lunch, or even dinner as you watch the sunset out beyond Koh Samet (Samet Island), just offshore.

There are also several sit down restaurants, also offering fresh fish and seafood, as well as other Thai dishes.

The only drawback is that some parts of the beach are less than clean, with accumulation of rubbish and garbage.",4,mind suan son interesting beach rayong province coastline enter beach along road arboreal archway formed tall casuarina pine growing either side road beauty especially sunlight filter leafy canopy one end beach many small colourful fishing boat pulled sandy beach night sea behind local set stall selling catch fish crab many variety prawn many variety shellfish seafood market popular local price right beyond many small cabintype seafood restaurant deckchairs table set beach front ideal way relaxing seafood lunch even dinner watch sunset beyond koh samet samet island offshore also several sit restaurant also offering fresh fish seafood well thai dish drawback part beach less clean accumulation rubbish garbage

You can easily access Wat Tha Ka Rong by bike, in particular if you do a loop coming from the North East to the North West, a good stop before going to Wat Chai Wattanaram for the sunset.
I don't want to spoil it for you, but the place in the most amazing accumulation of religious stuff of every color and material for many religions. The place is incredibly colorful. The fun lies in observing people and places of ""worship"". A paradise for photographers. The place is also very big, with lots of different areas to explore.

Don't be scared by the animatronics skeletons ... 
Not a loss of time if you are in for something different.
During week ends, it is crowded (hence interesting).
I stayed several hours (see below), and I did not see any other foreigner.
On week ends, there is also a food floating market. When you go past the sellers of religious souvenirs, towards the river, you'll reach a floating platform. Many kitchen boats are attached to it, proposing a couple of dishes each. The platform has tables and chairs, and places selling cold water. Just choose any food and eat at the tables. The food is delicious and ridiculously cheap (starting 20B/dish). At the east corner, there is a larger boat moored to the platform proposing foot massage (250B/h) and full body massage (350B/h), again very cheap.
I arrived at the temple around noon, spent time in there, had lunch at the floating market, and a massage (fantastic after a 5h of biking under a sizzling sun). I got in time for the sunset at Wat Chai Wattanaram.

My husband and his brother decide to have some street food lunch, it looked decidedly pink with I don't know what was in it... but it didn't appeal to me at all.. so I wandered around to take in some of the sights..
We saw coach loads of people gathering at the temple with small bottles of oil, little bits of paper (for wishes?) and some  gold leaf which they stuck onto the already very golden Buddha .. but I guess a few more  thin leaves of gold was highly appreciated and prayers would be answered more quickly

I walked towards the Nan river to be met by various stalls selling live creatures in small,
Plastic bags.. I was asked if I wanted to buy some, but with a polite and friendly smile I gracefully declined their kind offer to purchase.

Live frogs gasping for air, small turtles, eels, ( well, I think  they were eels) it was all a bit too too  much for me, as an animal lover I totally object to these creatures being sold alive to be cooked in a pot & eaten.  Plus I would have thought, that being strict Buddhists, that these people would treat animals kindly.

""The doctrine of right livelihood teaches Buddhists to avoid any work connected with the killing of animals.  The doctrine of karma teaches that any wrong behaviour will have to be paid for in a future life - so cruel acts to animals should be avoided"" ....

649,4504759,"Before visiting the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, It’s worth taking at least a quick glance at the history behind the statue which is housed at its centre and after which it is named. Recorded as existing as far back as the early 1400s, the story of this statue encompasses significant parts of the history of the people and the country. Originating in the Lanna kingdom in what is now northern Thailand, and being enshrined in Bangkok at the beginning of the Chakri Dynasty, it continues to hold a central place in Thai culture, being part of major religious and royal rites annually. Understanding this really allows you to put in context what appears to be a rather small statue seen from a distance.

However this temple is not just about the statue, as the grounds contain not only amazing architecture from a variety of periods, built during restorations and renovations by previous Kings, but also a plethora of statues dotted around the area, both created in Thailand, and brought by trade from China. 

A favourite for many, including myself, is the golden chedi held up by brightly coloured yakkas, But it is worth spending some time exploring the knocks and crannies and finding beautiful bowls, statues, designs and views all over the place.

One thing to be aware of, is that due to the huge popularity of this temple and the whole area, it can get extremely busy, So be prepared for the crowds or try and make it as early as possible.",4,visiting temple emerald buddha worth taking least quick glance history behind statue housed centre named recorded existing far back early story statue encompasses significant part history people country originating lanna kingdom northern thailand enshrined bangkok beginning chakri dynasty continues hold central place thai culture part major religious royal rite annually understanding really allows put context appears rather small statue seen distance however temple statue ground contain amazing architecture variety period built restoration renovation previous king also plethora statue dotted around area created thailand brought trade china favourite many including golden chedi held brightly coloured yakkas worth spending time exploring knock cranny finding beautiful bowl statue design view place one thing aware due huge popularity temple whole area get extremely busy prepared crowd try make early possible

THE PASEO PARK is located on the Kanchanaphisek road between Petchkasem road and Boromarajonani road near the Association Southerner. There have the label show the stores in front of the park. I think it looks strange and unconventional.
The symbol of this place is the red Torii door. It looks like the door of heaven in Japanese believe. There have a lot of restaurant especially the Japanese restaurant.The middle of walkway has the small stream and Japanese bridges. 
I think the bridges look so cute and there have the restaurant that we rarely seen.
I often go to this place because it nears to my home and easies to go.

Overall, I think this place is very beautiful. It likes I am walking in Japan.
The decorations are very beautiful, good design, good to take photos, have a lot of restaurant. But I think there have less parking. Sometimes there have a lot car but no people so I think maybe because the parking are free so they took their car to park here and go to the others place.If we go in the afternoon, it will be very hot because it is the outdoors mall but there have the Plaza part.In Friday-Sunday, there will have the market inside the park and there have a lot of things to look and buy.

720,15198195,"Wat Nuea is a very underrated temple and overlooked by most visitors to Roi Et. It is located north-west of Bueng Phlan Chai Lake and exactly north of the Monument of Phra Khattiyawongsa, the first ruler of Roi-et. For Thai-temple enthusiasts it has some interesting things to offer.

There is a 1200 year old chedi made from bricks. In contrary to most chedis in Thailand, this one though bell-shaped like the others, has four corners.

Behind this unusual chedi are three Buddha statues that are completely black with a shiny surface. Some sources on the internet say that a black Buddha shows a connection to Buddhism, spreading to African regions. Some of black Buddha images in India even show African facial features. But Here in Roi Et I was unable to obtain any proof for this part of history.

On entering the compound, you will pass a 39 metre tall and colourful Buddha image in meditating pose. Underneath is a prayer hall with the regular gold coloured Buddha statue, that is surrounded by several life-sized wax figures of (I assume) famous monks of the recent past.

If you go there alone and not in the high-season, you might be lucky enough (like I was) to be given the “grand tour of the house” by a very friendly monk and a female temple staff. Basic knowledge of some conversational Thai would definitely enhance the chat and make the meeting as enjoyable for you as it was for me. Being invited like this, by people who did not speak a single word of English made it obvious to me how less Wat Nuea is frequented by foreign visitors, but still: they approached me and spent almost an hour showing me around. And no one asked for money or a donation. Of course I donated happily to the temple before leaving. 

Even without that experience, I am sure a visit to Wat Nuea will not disappoint you.

Note that the temple grounds are very clean and well maintained.",4,wat nuea underrated temple overlooked visitor roi et located northwest bueng phlan chai lake exactly north monument phra khattiyawongsa first ruler roiet thaitemple enthusiast interesting thing offer year old chedi made brick contrary chedis thailand one though bellshaped like others four corner behind unusual chedi three buddha statue completely black shiny surface source internet say black buddha show connection buddhism spreading african region black buddha image india even show african facial feature roi et unable obtain proof part history entering compound pas metre tall colourful buddha image meditating pose underneath prayer hall regular gold coloured buddha statue surrounded several lifesized wax figure assume famous monk recent past go alone highseason might lucky enough like given grand tour house friendly monk female temple staff basic knowledge conversational thai would definitely enhance chat make meeting enjoyable invited like people speak single word english made obvious less wat nuea frequented foreign visitor still approached spent almost hour showing around one asked money donation course donated happily temple leaving even without experience sure visit wat nuea disappoint note temple ground clean well maintained

Visitors are warned that it might be difficult to find clothes that fit unless you are very skinny.

820,8775173,"If Chiang Mai temple architecture has aroused your interest, Wat Ton Kwen, the best example of the classic Lanna style, is a must excursion.  In a quiet rural environment ten km south of Chiang Mai, it was built in 1858 and is basically still the same set of wooden, tile-roofed buildings, carefully and tastefully renovated over the years.  The viharn has a graceful, triple tiered roof and the woodwork around the entrance doors feature intricate carvings of birds, plants and mythical animals, some of them gilded or decorated with colored glass.  Stucco sculptures of serpent nagas emerging from mouths of makaras, a kind of hybrid crocodile, flank the stairway.  The interior features a large Buddha, but little else.  Only a fragment remains visible of the original murals.
       The other main compound building is the cruciform-shaped, open sided pavilion (mondop).  Also made of teakwood with tiled roofs, it originally served as quarters for a stopover of a procession of a Buddha relic from Chomthong to Chiang Mai.  The building is unique in Northern Thailand.  Now Wat Ton Kwen is no longer an active temple; maintained and preserved, but not a residence for monks.  Across the road from the compound entrance lies a pool with a wooden plank bridge across it and a few empty stilted houses.  Between the pond and the temple are the towering sugar palms that gave the temple its name.
       To reach Wat Ton Kwen, also called Wat Inthrawat, take the road going south alongside the canal west of the city.  Around the 10 km mark is the Ton Kwen intersection.

When I arrived there, it was quite quiet and there were not many people which was nice. To get to the top, you will have to climb up a set of stairs of about 180 steps.

It’s worth the effort when you reach the top and see the twin golden pagodas. For some reason, women cannot go through the gates to the double pagodas to get a close look at them. To be honest, it’s not important to get a close look anyways. I did not even go through the gates. I just stood outside and took a few photos.

 When I arrived, I walked around Dream World with my group of friends.  In terms of the player  I like all the rides, but the rides that have oil will make you wet. I recommend that before going to Dream World people bring a raincoat as it will make you less wet or not at all. 

 About the food zone  There are a variety of things to eat, including savory food.  Desserts and drinks 

 As for the game arcade zone, it's fun to play and has a lot of variety, but it's a bit difficult to play. I think before you come to play, you have to think carefully.  You have to spend quite a bit of money.

 The last zone is the sales zone. There are clothes, toys, and a variety of items for sale at prices that are appropriate for the products.

934,6668933,"Forty five years ago I sat on a wooden stool in a small street in the suburbs of Bangkok and watched a Thai shadow puppet show.  I didn't understand what was going on because all the singing and chanting was in Thai, but I was thoroughly enthralled with the antics of the shadow puppets and the skill with which the puppeteers manipulated them.

You would be very lucky to find such an authentic shadow puppet show today, but this ancient Thai theatre form is kept alive and well at several places throughout Thailand.

One such is Wat Ban Don in Rayong Province, about 170 km south of Bangkok, which has been performing and preserving the art form for 200 years.

Shadow puppets, or Nang Yai in Thai, are carved from a single large piece of buffalo hide and then painted.  Backed by soft light, the puppets are moved across a screen to tell the story, accompanied by singing, chanting and music.

The art form originated in the 15th century in the southern provinces of Thailand.  The ruler of Rayong Province, Phraya Sri Samut Phokhaphai Chokchitsongkhram (Ket Yomchinda for short), heard about the puppets and hired a puppet troupe to come to Rayong to teach the art form and perform shadow puppet plays.

Wat Don Ban is now home to more than 100 puppets, some of them authenticated as 200 years old.

The shadow play stories are based on the Indian epic Ramakien or Ramayana.

You can watch a performance at Wat Ban Don but you must give three days notice.",4,forty five year ago sat wooden stool small street suburb bangkok watched thai shadow puppet show didnt understand going singing chanting thai thoroughly enthralled antic shadow puppet skill puppeteer manipulated would lucky find authentic shadow puppet show today ancient thai theatre form kept alive well several place throughout thailand one wat ban rayong province km south bangkok performing preserving art form year shadow puppet nang yai thai carved single large piece buffalo hide painted backed soft light puppet moved across screen tell story accompanied singing chanting music art form originated th century southern province thailand ruler rayong province phraya sri samut phokhaphai chokchitsongkhram ket yomchinda short heard puppet hired puppet troupe come rayong teach art form perform shadow puppet play wat ban home puppet authenticated year old shadow play story based indian epic ramakien ramayana watch performance wat ban must give three day notice

Then there is a Muslim mosque, with a sign declaring that the god of Muslim is the same as the god of Buddhists.  That is news to me, because Buddhism actually does not believe in a god as such.

Best of all is ""The Land of Heaven"" where the faithful bathe in a land of milk and honey, and ""The Land of Hell"" where sinners meet their just rewards.

And the makers of the mannikins in ""The Land of Hell"" have let their imaginations run riot, with the condemned boiling in oil, being sawn in half, being eaten by huge vultures, being stricken with ghastly boils and skin complaints, being beheaded, emasculated, eviscerated, and all sorts of other delightful punishments.",4,wat phai rong wua km staying suphan buri drive worth huge temple complex one eclectic seen year travelling around thailand first range architectural style traditional thai temple indian style pagoda muslim mosque sign declaring god muslim god buddhist news buddhism actually believe god best land heaven faithful bathe land milk honey land hell sinner meet reward maker mannikin land hell let imagination run riot condemned boiling oil sawn half eaten huge vulture stricken ghastly boil skin complaint beheaded emasculated eviscerated sort delightful punishment

The Temple is set in lovely grounds and there is parking space outside in the road as well as the grounds. 
This is a very religious place for all visitors whether Thai Buddhists or those from another country and it's important to respect the many shrines that are here. Also shoes need to be taken off and left outside when actually going inside the Temple itself, again as a mark of respect. It is okay to take photographs though. The horses and dragons/serpents I believe are made from some kind of wax- they are amazing - although I can't be certain of that fact. Thai people believe that the Dragon and indeed praying to Buddha brings, good health, healing and even good luck for the future. There are monks who look after the place and any donations given by Thai People or Tourists- whether it be by buying flowers or candles or incense - all go to the upkeep of the place.

Then, a pickup truck brought us along the sloping path to the upper level (90 baht/person, back and forth). It should be note that other vehicles other than these pickup trucks are not allowed.

After reached the station, we saw a little cave with Buddha statue inside. We first turned left and walked a little bit to visit a pair of Buddha's footprints.

Next, after bought some water (recommend), we climbed up to the top of the mountain (almost 1 km, about 30 minutes). At the first stage, the path appears to be a ramp but after that they are sloping steel staircases. There are some resting points and cheer up quotes scattered along the path. We also visited the holy well during our trek.

We finally reached the top level of the mountain and noticed that there are two attractions at each peak. One is a pagoda with Buddha relic, while the other is an open air pavilion. With a few steps climbing up the stair, we found ourselves at the highest position. We worshipped the relic and enjoyed a stunning panorama view of many white pagodas on the top of the nearby mountains and the grassy field below. What a wonderful view!!

A word of caution: it is difficult to find this place, and even though you can see it on the mountaintop from more than 20 kilometers away, you may still find it hard to reach. Google maps took us to the wrong location and we had to ask locals two or three times before we got clear instructions to the access road.

There is a huge parking area down the hill from the temple, but a free shuttle ferrying people to the temple.

There is also a Thai Yai  Village fifty meters away although unless you have never seen houses on stilts before it is not remarkable, and the buildings are modern although in traditional style.There is a Yunan Village 1 km further along the road going uphill, then a Lisu Village 1.2 km away and Mor Pang Waterfall 2 km away.

1092,1181165,"Located in the heart of Nan city, the over 420 year old temple is unarguably a must visiting attraction. The temple has 4 principle Buddha images facing all 4 directions. What so special about the temple are its 150 year old beautiful wall murals. The wall paintings not only have a great artistic visual art but also have a historical value as they depict local ways of life such as native attires, courtship. Here, we had a little girl as our local guide explained us about the detail of each painting.

1. The Mona Lisa of Nan = A beautiful woman wearing her hair in a bun after finished taking a bath.

2. The Noble Woman = A noble lady in traditional dress smoking a cigarette, since the smoke from the tobacco can keep away mosquitos and harmful insects.

3. The Noble Man = A noble man smoking a cigarette. Notice that he has tattoos from his belly down to his knees according to the local tradition.

4. At the boat dock = Group of young people meet for dating at the boat dock. If a man is interested in a woman, he will ask her to light a cigarette. If the woman is interested in him, she will offer to light his.

5. Young Lovebirds = Young teenagers in a scene of dating. According to our guide, the young lady asks the man, “Have you ever had a woman before?”. The young man replies “No, I haven’t. Do your parents allow me to be in your house?”. The lady says “Even my parents do not allow you inside my house, but I do allow you inside my heart”. I really love this scene. What a romantic!

6. The Whispering Lovers = A man whispering something to the ear of a woman (ask your guide what did he say to her ; so sweet). This iconic painting becomes the symbol of Nan as you can see this painting everywhere in Nan (not only in the city). We also bought a wooden wall mirror with doors hand decorated with this painting as a souvenir.

It is said that if you travel to Nan without visiting this temple, it means you have not really visited Nan. I couldn't agree more.",5,located heart nan city year old temple unarguably must visiting attraction temple principle buddha image facing direction special temple year old beautiful wall mural wall painting great artistic visual art also historical value depict local way life native attire courtship little girl local guide explained u detail painting mona lisa nan beautiful woman wearing hair bun finished taking bath noble woman noble lady traditional dress smoking cigarette since smoke tobacco keep away mosquito harmful insect noble man noble man smoking cigarette notice tattoo belly knee according local tradition boat dock group young people meet dating boat dock man interested woman ask light cigarette woman interested offer light young lovebird young teenager scene dating according guide young lady asks man ever woman young man reply havent parent allow house lady say even parent allow inside house allow inside heart really love scene romantic whispering lover man whispering something ear woman ask guide say sweet iconic painting becomes symbol nan see painting everywhere nan city also bought wooden wall mirror door hand decorated painting souvenir said travel nan without visiting temple mean really visited nan couldnt agree

1097,3654356,"Wat Intharawihan is a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, famous for its huge Buddha statue - 32 m high and 10 m wide. The construction of this monument began in 1867 and ended 60 years later, in 1927. It was also covered in 1982 with a golden mosaic imported from Italy. The inspiration for the statue was Somdet To - the most famous Buddhist monk in Thailand during the Kingdom of Rattanakosin, who died in 1871 at the foot of the statue, which was still being built at that time.

When visiting the temple complex, you can also see shrines and monuments of other deities or historical figures, such as Guan Yin, the goddess of mercy, or kings Naresuan, Taksin and Rama V. The Holy Well also plays an important role for the followers of Buddhism and the people of Bangkok. Inside the Ordination Hall there are beautiful murals depicting everyday life in Siam.

1142,12048666,"Wat Phai Lom, located on the banks of the Chao Phraya River in Pathum Thani, is (in)famous for what it destroyed rather than what it is!  For decades, the trees around Wat Phai Lom were the winter nesting sanctuary for hundreds, if not thousands, of Asian open-billed storks.  The scene was truly fantastic and the cool-season nesting site attracted thousands of human visitors to see the fabulous sight of the graceful migratory birds.  The stork chicks and fledglings were especially endearing to observe!

For years, the human visitors spent considerable amounts of money on snacks and drinks and obviously contributed generously to the temple during their pilgrimages to the stork sanctuary.  In a stupendously idiotic tragedy, however, the temple abbot and decision makers went on a huge construction binge, knocking down trees, piling up construction materials, making loud disturbing noises, and otherwise making the area unattractive to the nesting storks. To make a long story short, they managed to ""kill the storks that laid the golden eggs.""  The storks got fed up with the disruptions to their mating and nesting and abruptly stopped returning to the temple grounds about five years ago (various reports are that the storks are now nesting in Buriram, Nakon Sawong, Nakon Chaisi, and elsewhere).

The temple grounds are now blighted by a huge temple building dedicated to the storks that no longer visit (unmaintained, falling apart, and home to a large number of pigeons), a crumbling giant sculpture of stork, and a large empty parking lot. Almost no visitors go to the temple nowadays. Unfortunately, there is really nothing for tourists to see here anymore except for evidence of human folly and disrespect for nature.",1,wat phai lom located bank chao phraya river pathum thani infamous destroyed rather decade tree around wat phai lom winter nesting sanctuary hundred thousand asian openbilled stork scene truly fantastic coolseason nesting site attracted thousand human visitor see fabulous sight graceful migratory bird stork chick fledgling especially endearing observe year human visitor spent considerable amount money snack drink obviously contributed generously temple pilgrimage stork sanctuary stupendously idiotic tragedy however temple abbot decision maker went huge construction binge knocking tree piling construction material making loud disturbing noise otherwise making area unattractive nesting stork make long story short managed kill stork laid golden egg stork got fed disruption mating nesting abruptly stopped returning temple ground five year ago various report stork nesting buriram nakon sawong nakon chaisi elsewhere temple ground blighted huge temple building dedicated stork longer visit unmaintained falling apart home large number pigeon crumbling giant sculpture stork large empty parking lot almost visitor go temple nowadays unfortunately really nothing tourist see anymore except evidence human folly disrespect nature

The colony is located high up in the roof of the shrine of one of the temple’s founders, and is guarded at all times to stop thieves stealing the valuable nests.

The colony has been using this building for thirty years, and some nests are harvested annually to pay for the protection of the colony and for tubs of mealworms used to feed very young swiftlets that are routinely found on the temple floor and are looked after until (hopefully) they fledge.

1188,6669526,"C’mon See… the Geological Resource Museum!  
By:Hanna Kim    

Introduction 
->Do you want to see the museum that tells everything about rocks? If you do, you made a good choice reading this review! This museum talks about minerals and rocks, but it even teaches about the earth. And this museum even sells a collection of rocks and minerals. If you are learning about minerals and rocks at your school for science, you made a great choice! C’mon, what are you waiting for? Read along, see what it has!
 

Of Course, Lot of Teaching! 
->This amazing museum has a lot a teaching. You see, down, up, left, right, it all has millions of teaching. It even teaches you how rocks are made. This is one fact that I learned from there. Every rock in the world is always from a volcano. Every fact has an little picture explaining. This fact has an picture with a cycle. It teaches at first how the rock was made, how it gets soft, and how it gets hard. Now you will think how could a rock could be soft? But it is true. Before it gets hard, the rock will be soft. It gets hard because all of the rain, wind, and the sun! Before I didn’t go to the museum, I didn’t know even a tiny bit of rocks and museum. But now, I know way more than my 14 years old big sister. Now you know Geological Recourse Museum’s first reason to go. But there is two more reasons to go, so don’t be tired reading now!    

Some Kind of Special! 
->Geological Recourse Museum has some kind of special! It means it has a special event. Are you sad I said event, not events? If you hear what I say you will be happy than sad. Are you ready to listen? All righty then, really? Okay, it has a place where you can find a fossil with a brush. Like there is a place where’s sand over the sand. Get it? And one more thing is there is no people but they could go any moment. So if you go faster, the better. Are you very excited now that you are begging your parents now? You would be never sad if you try the event. Trust me, it’s true!	

Best Place Ever!	
->Now you heard my two reasons but remember there is one more reason left! I told you there was a museum that had lot of teaching and some kind of special. But there is one more to hear! Next to the Geological Recourse Museum, there is a shop where you can buy rocks and minerals. I told you there was somewhere where you could buy mineral and rock collections but this is a different place! But sometimes the shop closed. But you could still go  next to the shop and look what there is! Even though the shop is closed, there is a place where there is rocks and minerals lying on the floor. And the best part is that it’s... FREE!!! I didn’t buy the rocks on the shop but sometimes it better if you do. You have to make a good choice. It’s your choice!

Conclusion:   
->Now you heard my three reasons are you going to run out of your house? If you like this review, you’re going to like my other ones, too. I hope you enjoy your trip! Remember, the faster you go, the better!",4,cmon see geological resource museum byhanna kim introduction want see museum tell everything rock made good choice reading review museum talk mineral rock even teach earth museum even sell collection rock mineral learning mineral rock school science made great choice cmon waiting read along see course lot teaching amazing museum lot teaching see left right million teaching even teach rock made one fact learned every rock world always volcano every fact little picture explaining fact picture cycle teach first rock made get soft get hard think could rock could soft true get hard rock soft get hard rain wind sun didnt go museum didnt know even tiny bit rock museum know way year old big sister know geological recourse museum first reason go two reason go dont tired reading kind special geological recourse museum kind special mean special event sad said event event hear say happy sad ready listen righty really okay place find fossil brush like place wheres sand sand get one thing people could go moment go faster better excited begging parent would never sad try event trust true best place ever heard two reason remember one reason left told museum lot teaching kind special one hear next geological recourse museum shop buy rock mineral told somewhere could buy mineral rock collection different place sometimes shop closed could still go next shop look even though shop closed place rock mineral lying floor best part free didnt buy rock shop sometimes better make good choice choice conclusion heard three reason going run house like review youre going like one hope enjoy trip remember faster go better

We spent a huge amount of time with all of the elephants and had a non-stop abundance of food to feed them.  We were lucky enough to complete 'health' checks and delighted in the sheer enjoyment of just watching.  Obviously, baby Honey was a cheeky hit with all our family as was Sandee in her retirement years.

1198,15637904,"It was one of the best experiences of my life. We booked the elephant care package and was picked up at our hotel, the staff were so welcoming and talked us through the day and the elephants and their personalities. We were then able to feed all the elephants and speak to their person. After that we went and was shown how to prepare the sugarcane and make the herby balls and then went to feed those to the elephants. We were provided water and watermelon throughout to ensure we were hydrated. 
We then went to bath our elephant (we chose the grandma Sandy), it was such an incredible moment. 
All of this was also documented through photos and videos for us by our guide and there was even a photographer who came down to take some photos whilst we were bathing the elephants. 
Once this was done we headed back to the seating area and we're blown away by being provided a photo frame with 3 photographs from the day at no extra cost. We tipped Sandy's handler (Da) and the Sanctuary for providing us memories which will last a lifetime. 
We were also provided a voucher for lunch at the Memories bar which was a few minutes walk down the road at the beautiful beach and then picked up again to be taken back to our hotel. 
I would come back to Thailand just for this alone, overall for 2 of us for this amazing experience it costs us around £150... Absolutely incredible value.
The elephants are extremely well cared for also and have such a beautiful bond with their handlers.

We arranged a driver with our hotel---$110 for 10 hours. The park is part of the foraging range of elephants, so you could come around a bend in the road or on the trail and see elephants! Sadly, we did not get that lucky. But we did see a bunch of monkeys and a very cool reptile.
The park has several trails ranging 1-8km with waterfalls and rope bridges. So lots of choices. We saw a really gorgeous waterfall, I think it was Haew Narok waterfall. Beautiful, but be advised, many steps to get to the bottom of it---the steps are steep but shallow, so anyone with a large foot may want to walk them sideways (we saw people doing that.)

1214,4322512,"We hired a private driver from Bangkok with the tour company Bangkok Best tour, (bkkbesttour@hotmail.com,+66869032963), cost about 6000THB. He was handy to have as a translator. Drive took about 3 hours.

Arriving at the mountain, you are offered the option to hire a guide which I didn't mind  just in case something would happen. There are thousands of starving monkeys so be very careful when feeding them. Just buy a banana basket from one of the carts and TOSS THE WHOLE THING don't throw one by one as you will see it will quickly escalate into a screaming frenzy. 

To go up the mountain peak is very steep. AVOID if you have vertigo or fear of heights. It will start with a flight of stairs which can be hard if you have bad cardio. But you can also take your time and reset. After the stairs you have to climb up metal ladders, no straps and no safety so BE VERY CAREFUL. Once at the top it will look majestic. There's a sitting Buddha and bells. Very bucolic and worthy of an Instagram moment.

The next place to visit is near the temple. There's a flight of colorful stairs that will take you up to a reclining Buddha closed behind gates. You need a guide to take you in. Ask him to show the bats or say ""kangaw"" in Thai they will understand. There's a secret entrance behind the Budhha where you will witness thousands of bats hovering in silence. 

The last thing to see is the flight of a million bats that come out at the beginning of sunset, around 6pm. Head to the food court at the entrance and look at the peaks past the city hall office. Otherwise you can also ask the locals they know. You can enjoy an amazing cheap meal at the family operated restaurant. Beware of the monkey that will snatch your food when  you aren't looking.

One last thing to know, this place isn't a sanitized theme park. You will come real close with wildlife. It's also a bit run down and the smell of monkey feces is everywhere (it is their home after all).

1215,4322512,"This is by far the most scariest hike that I have ever done. Note that I am just an amateur hiker so the bar is pretty low but note that there were people who turned around and no longer climbed to the top. The reason is because the scariest part of the climb are the very steep metal ladders that you need to take before reaching the peak. The ladders are made up of large metal pipes which are around 4-5 inches in diameter and are inclined at about 60-70 degrees steep. Yes, almost vertical. Each step were spaced far apart that anyone with short legs will have a hard time climbing them. Also, there were no flat platform on each step, but only that thick round metal pipe. Good thing that it wasn’t raining that day, or else, if the stairs are slippery then we would’ve turned around also. And the scary part is that if you slip, then you’ll fall a considerable height, around 2 stories high. Experience may differ from person to person, but my legs were shaking when going down. Remember that by the time that you get to the stairs part, you’ll be pretty much tired already.

After conquering the hike, you’ll be rewarded with an amazing view! I know you have already seen the pictures. It’s really really good.

By the way, the place is full of monkeys and there is secure parking area which reminded me of zombie movie scenes wherein when going in, someone has to open the gate and stay guard so that no monkey comes close then you have to close the gate quickly again afterwards. The keeper uses a broom to scare them off. There’s a donation box which we just put money as there was no more attendant when we left. Please be careful with your stuff, donlt bring plastic bags as the monkeys will think that it’s food and try to take it from you.

I don’t think that there were public transportation to this place. We had a car that we rode from Bangkok to here. There are minivans that go from Bangkok to  Kampaeng Phet which also passes through Nakhon Sawan but this place is very far from any town center.",3,far scariest hike ever done note amateur hiker bar pretty low note people turned around longer climbed top reason scariest part climb steep metal ladder need take reaching peak ladder made large metal pipe around inch diameter inclined degree steep yes almost vertical step spaced far apart anyone short leg hard time climbing also flat platform step thick round metal pipe good thing wasnt raining day else stair slippery wouldve turned around also scary part slip youll fall considerable height around story high experience may differ person person leg shaking going remember time get stair part youll pretty much tired already conquering hike youll rewarded amazing view know already seen picture really really good way place full monkey secure parking area reminded zombie movie scene wherein going someone open gate stay guard monkey come close close gate quickly afterwards keeper us broom scare there donation box put money attendant left please careful stuff donlt bring plastic bag monkey think food try take dont think public transportation place car rode bangkok minivan go bangkok kampaeng phet also pass nakhon sawan place far town center

The cave is situated about 45 minutes from Hua Hin, a short distance up a rough, but manageable, drive leading off the main rural road.  Upon reaching the small parking area, a local person will provide a light for each person entering the cave and point the way up a short set of stairs leading to the cave.  There is also a rudimentary electric lighting system in the cave so it is quite easy to get around.  The main passageways are clear and the steeper sections are aided with a handrail and steps.  There are still a few slippery spots, however, so visitors should proceed with caution.

The cave has some very nice formations and quite a sizeable bat colony (plenty of guano to stick to your shoes!).  The big attraction for me, however, was the presence of a very large number of cave crickets with incredibly long antennae (approx 20 centimetres in length). This was the biggest population of cave crickets I've seen in Thailand.  Visitors must respect the fragility of the cave ecosystem and avoid disturbance of the crickets and bats.

1272,19900044,"Phra Wihan Temple has been a source of dispute between Thailand and Cambodia for many years. From Wikipedia we learn that In 1907 the Thai-Cambodian border was mapped by the French on behalf of a bilateral border commission. According to the 1904 agreement, the border would follow the natural watershed between the countries. However, the resulting map deviated by showing Preah Vihear Temple as being in Cambodia, even though it is on the Thai side of the watershed. Thailand accepted the map for official use. The Thais discovered the error when they made their own survey in the 1930s, but the International Court of Justice ruled that they had waited too long to protest and lost the temple by ""acquiescence"". 
So now you can only visit the temple from the Cambodian side. For those with strong interest in the political and historical aspects one could go in from the Thai side. Entrance is 400 baht for a foreigner. But for the politically not interested there is not much to see. You can follow a path (""up along the flower pots"") where you run into a small army settlement and barbed wire to stop you from going further. In the far distance you can see the stairs go up.
There is some kind structure depicting man and woman and a lookout post from where you can see the temple through binoculars. Finally a stone carving can be visited.

There is a large car park immediately adjacent to the cave entrance and toilets can be found near the entrance. There are several food stalls selling bananas to feed the monkeys but don’t bother as they seem quite capable of stealing their own food!

The main possible difficulty within the temple are some of the steps which in places are uneven and wet. There are some handrails but anyone suffering from mobility problems will need to to take extra care.

There are many interesting features particularly the golden reclining Buddha which dominates part of the temple but there are many other artifacts worth close study.

📍 No admission fee but donations are requested 
📍 10 THB per person to ride the elevator 

Off the beaten path lies Wat Samphran, also known as the “Dragon Temple.” It is located approximately 15 min from After the Rain Coffee & Gallery (20 min from Bubble in the Forest Cafe).

There is no admission fee to enter this Buddhist temple. However, donations are highly requested.

Showcasing a unique mix of Thai and Chinese architecture, this 17-story pink tower features a giant green dragon encircling the entire temple. The paint colors have faded over the years, but doesn’t take away from how truly stunning it is. 

The dragon’s body is hollow and is essentially a winding tunnel. For a small donation, you can walk up the length of the dragon, all the way up to the rooftop. 

The dragon wrapped around the tower from bottom to the top symbolizes the “ascent to enlightenment - from sorrow to happiness and from hell to heaven.”

An elevator is available if climbing up a dragon’s body isn’t your cup of tea. However, a donation of 10 THB per person is requested.

Footwear must be removed prior to entering the temple, so come prepared with socks. Despite fans spread throughout the tunnel, it was still blazing hot. 

Since this is an active temple, monks were to be expected. However, I didn’t expect female monks! ALL of the monks we encountered as we walked through the temple grounds were female. 

I had donned a light cardigan to adhere to the temple’s dress code, but it seemed like they weren’t too strict about it. Several female visitors had exposed shoulders and were still able to enter the temple. 

Larger than life pictures of the past and present King and Queen of Thailand are displayed prominently near the temple’s entrance. Please note, it is a crime to speak disrespectfully of the Thai Royal family and is punishable with jail time.

We start by feeding the elephants - wow they are such amazing animals so gentle and so much personality. It is amazing to watch them eat with their trunks - they use their trunks for everything!! Then we walk with them over to the pond and get in the water and bath them (this is when you get wet!!) It is a really great experience. I am not sure it would be the same with a large group… We interact with three elephants - each has his own person accompanying them.

What an incredible experience at Elephant Rescue Park. And ‘rescue’ is exactly the right word because the elephants all had a difficult past and are now living a very caring, free and wonderful life together with the great help of the carers.

Our 2 guides, Mr Shawn and Mr Chai were great company and enjoyed every minute in their and their colleagues company. 
They picked us up by minibus from our hotel in the centre of Chiang Mai
We first fed the elephants, walked a beautiful route in the nature and then washed and scrubbed the elephants in the lake with the clothes, hats and boots we were given.
After that a fresh and tasty lunch too.
Plenty of time for photos during the trip. They also have a photographer who takes really nice photos for a certain price.
We’d like to say thanks to Shawn, Chai and team for the best day out so far in Thailand. The kids and us recommend it to everyone!!

The Burmese army surrounded Ayutthaya by using the invasion route via the Three Pagodas Pass from Kanchanaburi to the west, and then to the capital Ayutthaya. The King  mounted his war elephant in preparation for battle. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai (the Queen) was so worried that she dressed in military attire and followed them on a war elephant. When the Ayutthaya army had faced the vanguard of the Burmese army , Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) engaged the enemy  but the elephant charged away from the enemy. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai, therefore, charged ahead between the King and the Viceroy to block his pursuit and was fatally injured. Whenever the Burmese saw that it was a lady killed in battle they stopped.

Later we could see some gaur in the distance. But in the later part of the tour we could see a large herd of gaur very close to the road, which was an impressing sight. And towards the end of the tour, around 5 p.m., we got to see a large group of elephants at close distance. They even passed the road around 30 m from the car. Several mothers and baby elephants.

1527,2665295,"Chose this as we wanted to see the elephants but not those chained up in a zoo. Unfortunately there were no elephants to see nor any wildlife really apart from a handful of birds. The guides couldn't tell us when an elephant had last been seen - saying they thought there was 1 elephant in the park. Lots of people there to see them but none to be seen.
A little thought and they would have the elephants fitted with a tracking device or they could use a drone to locate any elephants.
It was a long drive there and back and we spent at least an hour searching to no avail.
Maybe there are more elephants at other times of the year (we were there at the end of the dry season). But I wouldn't recommend based on our experience.
The logistics are OK, turn up (I don't believe you can pre book), pay your fees (about 1800 BHT for 5 adults) and sit in the back of a pickup (no shade).",2,chose wanted see elephant chained zoo unfortunately elephant see wildlife really apart handful bird guide couldnt tell u elephant last seen saying thought elephant park lot people see none seen little thought would elephant fitted tracking device could use drone locate elephant long drive back spent least hour searching avail maybe elephant time year end dry season wouldnt recommend based experience logistics ok turn dont believe pre book pay fee bht adult sit back pickup shade

1529,2665295,"We arrived at the park entrance after an hour searching for the place.  Park officials at the main park informed us that the wildlife viewing was 3 kms away...NOT.   The signage for the area was very poor.
Paid our entrance fee and truck fee with guide, yes you are charged much more as a tourist but that is expected in many areas now.  What we did not expect or like was the fact that our guide spoke very little or no English at all altho we were assured before getting into the truck that we had someone we could understand.  Even with our google translator our guide seemed indifferent, did not know how many elephants were in the park, the size of the park or any background information pertaining to the park.  
Two dozen trucks driving around looking for elephants mid day and all shrugging their shoulders wondering if they will ever see anything. After 2 hours we spotted ""waldo"" in the form of a half dozen water buffalo way off in the distance, so far in fact you needed binoculars to see them.  At the end of the day the walkie talkies of the trucks sounded with sighting of elephants at the first look out.  With 2 dozen trucks in convoy we bounced over ill maintained dirt track to converge at lookout spotting ""waldo"" again mother and a young one off in the far distance.  We were somewhat pleased that at least we got to see a few elephants but perhaps the park could arrange opening earlier in the morning for a better chance at a closer encounter.  Our guide who basically paid no attention to us, quickly became our friend at the end of the excursion, smiling and essentially had her hand extended for a much anticipated ""tip""  which we ignored given the lack of guide service.

There is always action on the rods so you got to pay attention all day! All fish fought really strong and looked beautiful and healthy.
The surrounding: we booked the air con bungalow and it was an absolute dream! Living directly in the forest there are so many plants and flowers to explore. You always get extra information by Danny and maybe try fruits directly from its plant. The food was really delicious and fresh cooked.
Danny and his staff: visiting chumphon Fishing Resort, you will realise how many effort Danny and his staff put to build this place.

The only toilets are located at the parking area. They were clean enough and had both squat and sit down style with water hose, but no paper or soap. The hike to the falls is around 3km round trip from the parking area. It's a little steep in some areas but easily achieved without training or special footwear. When you first pass under the entry sign, the trail splits left and right. Both trails end up at the waterfall, so you can take one path on the way up and the other path on the way down. And when you get about 200 meters from the waterfall the trail splits again, with both trails ending at the waterfall. The trail is well marked and well maintained all the way. It is slippery around the falls, as the water drops with such force that a misty wind is created and everything here is wet. The only negative I could add is that there isn't much space around the falls, so if it's crowded you may have to wait a bit for photos.

1570,8610863,"Reading reviews about the othe major waterfalls I saw they all had access to elephant treks. Being an animal lover this was not something I wanted to see even if I wasn't going to partake. I would rather forego seeing a waterfall all together if it meant seeing animal abuse in action. Then I read about Khun Si Waterfall and thankfully I did. Not an elephant trek or tourist trap in sight!
This is an out of the way place, not far from Lamai but very much off the beaten track - even our local driver had never been and required GPS navigation to get there.
The road leading to the waterfall is very rough. Most drivers/cabs would not go down this road, thankfully our driver was really nice and was driving a modern 4x4 so he pretty much took us as far as you can by car/scooter.
Make sure you have no knee problems cos it's pretty steep and it can get very slippery when going through the forest to access the waterfall. When you get there you are greeted with 3 levels of waterfall. They aren't huge by any means but they are lovely to look at. When we got there there was only one other person taking pictures. It's very quiet so you can hear all the sounds of the forest around you. 
Afterwards we returned to rest at the lookout area at the entrance to the waterfall and it did not disappoint. 360 panoramic views of the forest and mountains. Spectacular.
Finally we walked 5mins down the road to check out the Chill Out Bar. You can order food and drink there but we opted to check out their amazing 9D garden which was no charge - so cool to see what common everyday commodities look like such as coffee plants, pepper trees, bananas, chillies etc. before they are processed.

1580,4322677,"The Wat Khun Inthapramun (InPramun) is a Buddhist temple which is located in Pho Thong, Ang Thong. The temple is located in a rural area (in the rice fields) about 10 Km North of Ang Thong town. On the grounds are the ruins of several ancient temple buildings & chedis. The largest reclining Buddha in Thailand is enshrined here.
 The main attraction of this sacred temple is the white reclining 50 meters long Buddha statue (Luang Phor Khao). The image was built at the Sukhothai era (7 centuries ago). The image of the reclining Buddha represents the entry of Buddha into Nirvana and the end of All reincarnations.
According to the legend, Khun Inthapramun was a royal tax collector and he used some of the tax for building a sacred object. Being discovered that, he was sentenced to death and his remains buried there. And temple was called Wat Khun Inthapramun.
We drove (about 15 km) from Wat Muang to Wat Khun Inthapramun. The navigation was somehow difficult and the navigating programs were not enough for finding the temple. So we asked the locals for the proper route, which was leading to the Wat. 
Currently the reclining Buddha is staying outdoor, it's not within the temple, since the original temple has been destroyed for a long time, Only the ruins of the pillars have remained. Around the reclining Buddha image there are some large trees and vast nice greenery. A new high-tech main hall has been built recently (for the temple) which has both elevator and escalator for the visitors. 
There's a very interesting attraction beside the Reclining Buddha, It's a vivid colorful outdoor market that sells Thai eatables and Thai, Buddhist souvenirs. The atmosphere of here is really friendly and peaceful and relatively not crowded.

1581,4322677,"I visited Wat Khun Inthapramun in 1 July 2018. Wat Khun Inthapramun is ancient temple that was constructed during the Sukhothai period, its vast size still outlined by brick ruins. The largest and longest reclining Buddha statue in Thailand, 50 meters from topknot to feet, is enshrined here.  Originally, the reclining Buddha image was housed in the image hall, or Wihan, but after a fire raged through the temple, the image was abandoned to the elements for hundreds of years. Many Thai kings have paid homage to the image, including King Borommakot in 1753, King Rama V in 1878 and 1908, as well as the current king, who presented royal Kathin robes in 1973 and 1975.
Inside an all-purpose pavilion, there is a statue of Khun Inthapramun (a much-storied figure) as well as his presumed remains. According to legend, Khun Inthapramun was a revenue officer who secretly embezzled from the government to build the massive Buddha image. When the King asked how he obtained the funds, Khun Inthapramun did not reveal the truth because he was afraid that merit from the construction of the image would be passed on to the King. He was finally sentenced to death.
There are three ways to get to the temple. First, take Ang Thong - Amphoe Pho Thong Route (Route No. 3064), then take a right turn at Km 9 for approximately 2 kilometers.  Or take the road from Sing Buri province towards Amphoe Chaiyo and take a left turn at approximately Km 64-65 for 4 kilometers to reach the temple. Alternatively, take the Amphoe Wiset - Chai Chan Pho Thong Route (along the irrigation canal road) and take a right turn when arriving at  Amphoe Pho Thong.

1582,4322677,"I visited this area during a guided tour of Ang Thong Province.

The central attraction is the reclining Buddha statue, which is said to be the longest reclining Buddha in Thailand. (It is about 50 meters long; the one at Wat Pho is said to be 46 meters long). I saw the statue and it was extraordinary. It was very well detailed, and it was amazing to just be able to stand next to something demonstrating such great craftsmanship.

There wasn't much else to the temple complex that I saw, but the statue was great.

1583,4322762,"The accessibility of the park by train is a big plus. No need for expensive taxi service or time-consuming bus changes. The hike was not touristy, but well traced and very enjoyable. The summit at the top offers a nice view and was very rewarding.

We took the 10 a.m. train from Lampang and arrived in the cute little station of Khun Tan at 11 a.m. You can leave your backpack at the station.  

From the station to the park's entrance, count 20 minutes by foot. At the time of visit (dec.2019), the entrance to the park was 100 baht. The visitor center at the entrance provides a free map of the park. There's also a small restaurant and a shop selling water bottles, among other things. 

There was only one trail, going to the summit. The other trail (towards the waterfall) seems to be closed since quite a while. 

The first part of the trail (from the visitor center to camp 1 (""yom 1"") lasts about 2km and is partly on the road. There are shortcuts cutting the road's hairpins. 

At camp 1, names and phone numbers (in case of emergency) are written down in a register. Looking at the register, I could see that only 14 persons were taking the hike the same day as myself. Although it was high season, Doi Khun Tan was not touristy at all. 

It took approx. 2h00 to cover the 5km from camp 1 to the summit. Adding the time needed to go from the train station to camp 1 (through the visitor center), I believe 2h30 at a ""normal"" pace is a realistic estimation to reach the summit.To go back down, two hours will suffice.

The trail is very well marked and easy to follow. No crossings, no confusion possible : it's all very straigt-forward. In december, the trail could be done without specific hiking shoes. In the wet season, this might be different. 

A train leaves Khun Tan at 18h23 to reach Chiang Mai at 19h30. Check Thai Royal Rail to check timetable changes.

At the same time, right next to some of the individual houses, are open excavations of grave sites that date from the first millennium BCE.

The close proximity these two places have to each other plus the fact that they share the same parking lot makes this misunderstanding plausible. And this is the reason why the wrong information is not so bad, since all you have to do is walk 100 metres to go to the right place.

1651,1754561,"...come here again. Like I texted the Israeli monk who kind of inspired me to make the trip: it's creepy here. A week or so ago, I saw Monk Idan speaking at the Sababa restaurant in town. I went to his website later on, made a donation to his cause whatever that is, and came out to see this temple he stays at. I know they gotta serious meditative Vipasanna thing going here, but it's a little too much for me: people all dressed in white, some oddly walking slowly in measured steps, some sitting in meditation with their eyes closed (a big no-no for me when I practice), and everything's just too eerily quiet. It's like no signs of life exist: no kids, no workers, no barking dogs, no chickens, no nothing. Everything's so sanitary and contrived unlike the more natural, local Thai temples I love to go to - Wat Pong Noi down the road for example. You know, I don't want to be critical about the way anybody practices their spirituality (or any other otherworldly matter for that matter), I'm just saying I feel outta place being here, and I don't want to be around anyplace that makes me feel that way. I was able to get my meditation and four sticks of incense thing I do in. If you follow me on TripAdvisor, and I don't think there is anybody in the world who does, then you know what I was talking about. Oh, I didn't turn-on the Buddhist chanting on my phone when I was meditating - thought the people around here wouldn't like it. Whoah, forgot to chant the Nembutsu too. Yeah I was distracted at this place. I will say, they do have some nice-looking and interesting structures here and everything seems to be maintained quite well - a lot of them new and quite shiny. The most beautiful is the main temple hall. I saw a sign that said monks only can enter, but the place is open and one can see it all. What else? On my way out, I did see Monk Idan talking intensely with some other foreigner like they were having a hard-to-heart chat. I don't think he noticed me, or would even remember me if he did, and I just walked past him. No, I did give him a quick wai too.

1654,1754561,"I've come here for a 10 day course twice, 6 years apart, and it has been profoundly healing and beneficial. Some reviewers have mentioned construction noise, and it's true that in the last 6-7 years a huge undertaking to renovate this 500 year old monastery has been underway. But it's all mostly done now, and there are so many perfect spots to meditate that if you find somewhere a bit noisey there are many other options, including an underground air conditioned room. ""Hearing, hearing, hearing.""

Personally I found the food excellent and struggled to not overeat (too much food = sluggish mind).

The instructors, especially Meichi Saree, are helpful and deeply compassionate. Phra Ajahn Suphan, the abbot and head teacher, has been at the monastery since he was 15 (35+ years ago) and is a kind and patient teacher.

I will say that if you're looking for a place that is extremely strict and serious, this is not it. They tell you not to talk and put signs up, but people do and nobody stops them. If you want to have a fruitful practice, refuse the urge to socialize at all, or even to make eye contact! It seems pleasant, but just gives the mind something to latch onto. I have heard that if you're looking for a more rigorous and intense practice, you can study with Phra Ajahn Suphan's teacher at Wat Phradat Sri Chomtong, but you should probably have at least one 10 day under your belt first.",5,ive come day course twice year apart profoundly healing beneficial reviewer mentioned construction noise true last year huge undertaking renovate year old monastery underway mostly done many perfect spot meditate find somewhere bit noisey many option including underground air conditioned room hearing hearing hearing personally found food excellent struggled overeat much food sluggish mind instructor especially meichi saree helpful deeply compassionate phra ajahn suphan abbot head teacher monastery since year ago kind patient teacher say youre looking place extremely strict serious tell talk put sign people nobody stop want fruitful practice refuse urge socialize even make eye contact seems pleasant give mind something latch onto heard youre looking rigorous intense practice study phra ajahn suphans teacher wat phradat sri chomtong probably least one day belt first

The bridge looks like it might have been built a hundred years ago, but in reality, the first bridge was built only in the mid-1980s when the water levels of Khao Laem lake rose upon filling of the reservoir, making travel from the Thai community to the Mon community more difficult.  The bridge was nearly totally destroyed in 2013, when flood waters carried logs and debris crashing into the bridge.  The bridge was rebuilt in the following year.  So, even though the bridge looks ancient, it is not really that old.  It is definitely very cool, though, and visitors will enjoy walking across.

1713,1746067,"We were in Chiang Mai for 5 days last November for Yi Peng (Flying Lantern Festival) and Loy Krathong (Floating Lantern Festival), and we had planned a 3 day Temple circuit in the Old City.We had pin pointed the most famous ones like Wat Chedi Luang Varavihara and Wat Phra Singh which are amazing.

But how many Temples can one visit, so we decided to make a break and look for a flower market.
There is one near Chiang Mai Chian Town but it is not very big so we preferred that one.

And what a surprise: no tourists at all.
Only a few locals ... and only flowers and plants.
Practically a Botanic Garden, a very big Garden.

I have attached plenty of pictures, hoping to give you kind of a feeling of this place.

If you like flowers, orchids and gardens this is definitely a Must See in Chiang Mai.

Now please do pay attention:  
Don't be careless (as we were) and make sure your cab or Tuktuk is waiting for you there to get back to the City Center and the Old City.
If you grabbed one and let it go away (like us) instead of waiting for you, this might not be such a good idea as it will be difficult to get one back.
A few baths will be a good investment to guarantee your way back promptly with no precious time wasted waiting.

I decided to go and check it out one morning and hopped on a tuktuk to get there.
From the moment I arrived it was clear that this was a popular event judging by the scores of people there ahead of me and the queue of cars, minivans and tuktuks dropping fresh shoppers off.
A host of stalls line site roads or unfold under trees and there is a fairly large central food area to recharge your batteries.
I went shopping first and ended up buying everything from teak wood floral painted mobile phone stands to brass embroidered book marks.
It got hotter and hotter so I briefly broke off to get myself a bag of fresh sliced pineapple before continuing to browse the stalls and also a large area of farmers' produce which was doing brisk business with the crowds.
Entry to the market was free, the toilets there were clean and well kept and large parts of the market were accessible for disabled people and wheelchairs.
One thing I liked was that there was a lot of seating available so if you wanted a break you didn't have to hunt too far to find somewhere to sit down.
Definitely worth a visit if you are in Chiang Mai and the handicrafts alone were very helpful for gifts and souvenirs.

There’s a large mother of pearl gallery with documentaries based on Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese techniques.

1825,6609104,"The Ton Son Mosque - nestled within the vibrant cityscape of Bangkok, Thailand, lies a lesser-known treasure of historical and cultural significance. This architectural gem, dating back to the early 19th century, is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of cultural diversity and harmony within the fabric of Thai society.

The Ton Son Mosque, also known as Masjid Ton Son or Ton Son Islamic Center, has a history dating back over a century. Built in 1849 during the reign of King Rama III, it stands as one of the oldest mosques in Bangkok. Its construction was initiated by Haji Sulong, a prominent Muslim merchant of the time, and it has since served as a focal point for the Muslim community in the area.

One of the most striking features of the Ton Son Mosque is its unique architectural style, which blends traditional Thai design elements with Islamic motifs. The mosque's façade is adorned with intricate carvings and colorful tiles, reflecting the artistic fusion of Thai and Islamic influences. Its minaret, crowned with a golden dome, stands tall against the Bangkok skyline, offering a picturesque sight that captures the essence of Islamic architecture.

In a city teeming with cultural wonders, the Ton Son Mosque stands as a testament to Thailand's rich multicultural heritage. Its timeless beauty, rich history, and vibrant community make it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking to explore the diverse tapestry of Bangkok's cultural landscape. Whether you're a devout Muslim, a history enthusiast, or simply a curious traveler, a visit to the Ton Son Mosque promises an unforgettable experience that celebrates the unity in diversity that defines Thailand's cultural identity.

1872,13510150,"We have a 3 year old and a 1.5 year old and it was a mindblowing trip for them.  A really straight forward 1.5 hr (max) drive from Bangkok.

When I arrived I was really pleased they had great coffee and the whole thing kicked off very relaxed in a lovely starting point.  The English Programme was perfect, the kids loved everything.  We also loved to see this farm is clearly taking its responsibilities to the animals and the farm as the priority, too often you come across theme park style attractions.  This was not like that, this was a top quality animal and plant farm full on caring details and sustainable concepts to introduce to our children.  

Although our children were young they had a blast and easily it would be brilliant for a lot of ages up to early teens where they would get a whole other level of experience from the trip.

Food was great, we were vegetarian and they set us up with a special table and all the food came from the farm.  (My 3 year old loved this concept)

They got their hands dirty, got stuck in with the animals, swam in the lake, played in the tree house, planted plants and painted.  Honestly it was so good I was thinking as i went round I should have told the kids it was their birthday present!

Staff were excellent and very helpful.

Want to conclude with a special note to our native English teacher.  He brought the balance of education and fun seamlessly.  He gave that feeling all good teachers have which is it can be fun but you need to respect the farm.  As a father this was exactly what I hoped my eldest would see.  She was given a lot of freedom but with it she had to be responsible.  

All in all a must in any Bangkok family's calendar

1875,4322676,"I visited the Court Doll Center during a guided tour of Ang Thong Province.

The Center is relatively small. Only two rooms were open when I was there: one room in which a craftswoman was making statues, and another showroom with a bunch of finished statues on display cases.

There was some information on the history of the court dolls, but there was nothing particularly interesting about their design or manufacture, and except for the one woman who was making dolls there weren't any other demonstrations. Since I wasn't interested in souvenir shopping, there wasn't much of anything to do. (My guide mentioned that there was a second floor with another room, but it was closed for some reason). 

If you want clay dolls, you can get them at other places in Bangkok or the surrounding region. You don't need to go all the way from Bangkok or elsewhere to this Court Doll Center. And if you don't want clay dolls but are just interested in how they are made or the history of the region, you're still not going to learn much coming here.

Jack Thomas has done an incredible job of putting together an elite group of trainers/coaches in a most conducive environment with great facilities. The trainers are fluent in English and Thai. They are friendly, knowledgeable and very clear in their instructions to the attendees. They give equal attention to all, are energetic and constantly encouraging you to work hard. Special mention goes out to coaches Stephany, Lee, Tommy, Sugar and Dustin even Tak whose class I did not even attend but was helpful.

The gym has a combination of weights and cardio equipment including treadmills, rowing machines and air bikes. Base also offers personal training. The gym is very clean with lockers and showers, towels and toiletries provided are free of charge. It has a small but excellent FuelBar where you can get snacks and protein shakes before or after your workouts.

A literal dragon probably doesn't live here but places have their own energy and feel and it's hard to be clear on the exact bounds for supernatural themes to be based on something, if not the actual literal stories being true.

The various shrines are tastefully designed with some architecture boasting elongated glistening gold roofs & elaborate Buddha statues.

I recommend you go early!! I think that's best for two reasons: 1) there are less people generally and 2) (perhaps more importantly), the sun is behind Buddha after 1pm so good photos are much harder to get until maybe after 5pm.

I was there till almost six and I'll tell you the thing about that is that getting the bus back to Bangkok gets much more difficult after 630pm 😳

That being said we were able to get one back at around 7:50 from close by the bus terminal, but not without wondering if and where we were gonna find a place to sleep in Ang Thong.

1953,2640745,"It's out in the country, so you'll need to arrange a mini-van or taxi transport. I went a friend by scooter, but it's both hot and dangerous. (Thai roads are not for beginners on scooters.) The tallest Buddha statue in gold can only be described as something worth seeing. It's not a mainstream tourist venue because of its remote location, and the fact that most tourists don't get to tour in Ang Thong province. If it were located near Bangkok it would be on every tour guides list of compulsory trips.

For me what was more impressive was the temples in the grounds of the Big Buddha statue. They are stunning. I've been to 50 temples or more, but these are in the top 10. One is hung wall to wall with artworks of incredible detail and high interest for scholars of Thailand history. They depict so much of Thai folklore and culture. Another is mirrored in and out, and simply breathtaking.
Of course there is much variety of food available, and shady places to sit and enjoy. Souvenir shops show off local wares, as well as the ""normal junk"". Something for everyone. If you have an extended stay, or if you've been to all the usual top 10 sites in Thailand, then this should be added to your list.
Nearby is another almost totally unknown temple which you can ask your driver to take you to, which will make it a full day trip out of Ang Thong town. It's called the Wat Ta It. It will add an additional 2 hours to your trip, but you'll never see anything like it anywhere else in Thailand. Call it a hidden secret. It about 7 stories high, built in a style of a pyramid.

1954,23306206,"Wat Muang is a couple of hours' drive north of Bangkok and well worth the trip if you're interested in the quirkiness of Thai culture. It has two man attractions:
(1) the biggest Buddha image in Thailand, standing at 90 metres including its platform and dominating the surrounding pancake-flat countryside, and
(2) the life-size dioramas in its grounds. There is a whole set of these, most make up a ""hell garden"" where the punishments inflicted on sinners in the afterlife and graphically displayed (some may be put off by this, Thais seem less squeamish about gore than Westerners ) while others represent scenes from mythology and Thai history.  Notices explain what is going on in each enclosure, in Thai only, but Google Translate helped make things clearer.
You can make a day trip of it from Bangkok (taxi and driver for the day, cost us about 3,000 baht) and take in something else on the way. For that I recommend Wat Niwet.

1988,7140147,"We went to this temple to see the Cave and the Monkeys. It’s quite nice but of course a little touristic (like every place in Thailand where there is something to see)... 😉

The temple is located in a cave, you reach it by climbing a few steps, that are a little slippery. Beware of different step heights.

There are a lot of Monkeys there with some baby monkeys, that were absolutely beautiful! If you behave like a person with a brain, they won’t harm you. Just some tips:

1. Get rid of that stupid bamboo stick! When monkeys know, they will get beaten with this stick, how do you think they will welcome you? 

2. Keep distance to Chinese tourists (sorry to those, who can behave). Except from the noise they emerge in a holy place... They run around screaming loud and forming groups with bamboo sticks around them when there is a monkey around... they try to hit them even when they just sit there...

3. Don’t feed monkeys with your trash, try to keep plastic away. There is nothing more sad to see than a monkey chewing on plastic stuff. :-(

4. Animals this size will never attack you, unless they feel threatened. Of course if you are loud and threaten them with a bamboo stick, they might have to defend themselves. Then don’t whine on here if they won the fight you started! 

I was standing on the stairs with monkeys around me in a distance of 0.5 meters. They didn’t even care I was there and were playing around. It was a beautiful scene to watch... 

So: Brain on when you Are there and enjoy the view and the animals instead of screaming and fighting!

1992,6668967,"Even amongst the tourists who make it to Phitsanulok (a rather neglected destination), the great majority will miss Chula Mani temple. This is probably because of its location, a few kilometres from the centre of town. Nonetheless, for history buffs, it is one of the city’s most rewarding destinations. This is possibly the best place to get a sense of the city’s ancient past.

Apparently, this part of town was the original centre of Phitsanulok during the Khmer era (often referred to in Thailand as the ‘Lopburi’ period). At that time, old Phitsanulok was just a small riverside settlement and this was its primary temple. Today, a number of intriguing vestiges can still be found here and the whole site is well-maintained.

The man sight is a beautiful laterite temple ruin, with a high base and beautiful stucco on the walls. Do not miss the exceptionally fine friezes of stucco swans. This graceful building is the centrepiece. However, you should also see the Buddha footprint in the brick mandapa and the treasured Buddha image in the main hall.

On the trip out, Jannis ran through the equipment, hand signals and gave us a brief on the 2 dives we would do in a very clear and consise manner putting our nerves at ease.

The first dive got us used to the equipment, ran through some basic skills and techniques before letting us marvel at the reefs below Sail rock and all the aquatic life around it. Jannis matched the pace of the dive with our confidence which grew throughout the experience.

We then broke for lunch which was incredible (big thanks to the boat crew for looking after us so well)

Honesty and integrity is somewhat missing in today’s world but everybody wants to achieve it and this man “PhanThai Norasing” did more than that: he paid his life for it! If you read the history he was described as a coxswain but basically he was in charge of teaching the Thai people how to navigate and captain the boats within Thailand. After he made a mistake of damaging the Kings figure head he was excused the normal sentence of death, he begged the King not to excuse him as others would use him as an example to do things wrong so the King did digress and he was executed. Beheaded at the actual spot he choose because he loved the view; he was given certain rights and the King respected him so much he had a shrine built and areas marked to the exact position where Phan Thai Norasing sat in his last moments before being beheaded and the figure head placed beside him. The full story is written on a plaque at his shrine, only written in Thai it was translated to me and my attitude changed immediately to this location, a very beautiful area and lots to see including the boat he damaged which I paced at 24 paces. Food, shops and all you need at this location. Well worth making time to visit this place of integrity and beauty.

2058,7378518,"This Wat was a true hilight of our Chiang Mai visit. We combined this with a visit to Queen Skirit Botanical Garden. 

This review is pertintent first to the independent traveller; second to one that wants a day excursion outside Chiang Mai; and third to any one wishing to avoid the crowds that populate Wats like Doi Suthep and Chedi Luang. 

Do this trip for the rural scenery and for a much different Wat experience. You can do this trip by car, motorbike or songthaews. Bicycling is not a reasonable day trip and as tough a climb as Wat Doi Suthep. 

Expect to take about 3-4 hours roundtrip to the Wat or more if you take a wrong turn.  Aim your vehicle north to Mae Rim, then start looking for signs on the left directing you to turn west (a Buddha footprint is most helpful when seen). Info from travelfish.org states 5km to the sign but just where to begin counting that is very uncertain. I must have started too late as we drove only 2km.  Follow signs and Buddha footprints for 25 km, but don't miss a left hand turn at about 12-13 km where we saw neither footprints or the English temple's name.  We were trying at that point without GPS because it failed over and over to recognise the Wat until we ran words together. That is to say we missed this turn; GPS or a very detailed map is mandatory and a time saver. 

Otherwise enjoy the rural Thai countryside and observe Thai lifestyle. This is rural mountain driving and passing other vehicles is always ""interesting"" even with concrete road all the way. You have arrived when you pass through a huge concrete gate where upon you can view the smaller temples first or continue driving 300+ meters to the main attraction.  Don't forget that the viewable Buddha footprint is in a lesser temple. 

If you want to be off the beaten path this trip provides that and a lot more.  This was our best experience of a three day four night Chiang Mai visit which included walking old town and all the major sites and Doi Suthep National Park, the Wat, Doi Pui Hmong village and Monthaathan Falls, and nightly street shopping bazaars.

2079,4777441,"This is a little-known but very beautiful temple compound in Lamphun’s suburbs north of the moat enclosing the old town.  It was originally the site of the first Buddhist temple in northern Thailand, dating from 541, long before the old city’s foundation.  Queen Chamathewi is said to have prayed here often and was cremated here when she died.  
       The original buildings have long since disappeared and those in Wat Sun Pa Yang Luang, its contemporary replacement, were constructed within the last two decades.  The compound contains a few viharns and shrines in the classic Lanna architectural style.  The elegant smaller shrines feature layered, sloping dark roofs with gold-trimmed edges.  Many multi-tiered white chedis stand in the yard, as well as a huge bell tower.  The buildings are all ornately decorated with sculpted figures of Buddhist angels, elephants emerging from the wall bases, large, trumpeting elephants outside the shrines and staircases lined with seven-headed nagas, lizard-like moms or Khmer-style dragon-headed lions.
       Located between the main road to Chiang Mai and the railway line, it is seldom visited by tourists, but well worth it for a sample of how classic temple art has survived into the modern age.",4,littleknown beautiful temple compound lamphuns suburb north moat enclosing old town originally site first buddhist temple northern thailand dating long old city foundation queen chamathewi said prayed often cremated died original building long since disappeared wat sun pa yang luang contemporary replacement constructed within last two decade compound contains viharns shrine classic lanna architectural style elegant smaller shrine feature layered sloping dark roof goldtrimmed edge many multitiered white chedis stand yard well huge bell tower building ornately decorated sculpted figure buddhist angel elephant emerging wall base large trumpeting elephant outside shrine staircase lined sevenheaded naga lizardlike mom khmerstyle dragonheaded lion located main road chiang mai railway line seldom visited tourist well worth sample classic temple art survived modern age

Jayavarman VII is considered to be the most powerful of all the Khmer Kings and was a patron of Mahayana Buddhism. In addition to building magnificent temples, a series of rest-houses and hospitals were constructed to aid weary travelers on their long journeys from the famous city-state of Angkor to the kingdom’s far western territories in present-day Thailand.

While most spas use lavender and rose oils, here they have massage treatments that use almond oil, macadamia oil and coconut oil which is really intriguing for someone with very dry skin such as myself. As this was my first time, I went for one of their more basic packages which involves a 60-minute almond oil massage and a 30-minute warm organic coconut oil massage where they combed the hot coconut oil into my roots gently and then massaged it into my scalp before masking it in a shower cap during the body massage. The almond oil was very moisturising and the tension was just right, I fell asleep at some intervals. There was a lot of stroking with palms and kneading which was an interesting change from the standard Thai massage most are used to. The service is also very friendly, I had a cough and the therapist got me some warm water mid-way. The only down side I see so far is that because it is a boutique spa, they don't have many facilities and I love steam rooms.

2123,2667297,"This review is for the Asian Herb Association massage shop on Sukhumvit.  There is no listing for it on TA. But I suspect all branches are exactly the same.

This was a huge disappointment.  At the beginning I felt ok, but then things got bad.  

The first issue is there are no beds.  You lay on the floor.   I have been getting massages once a week for over 20 years.  I consider myself an expert already as I use the techniques from multiple therapists at home on my family and myself.  The one thing I can tell you is that using towels on the floor bed are not very good for the neck.

I did not feel too bad afterwards, but I have neck issues and was greatly worried.

The biggest issue was firstly the therapist, and if the massage shop figures out who I am and you take money away from her because I am complaining on a public forum, shame on you!   The therapist did listen somewhat as I told the staff and her that I wanted a hard massage.  Well... the therapist basically mumbled that if you want a hard massage choose a Traditional Thai massage. Well, I cannot. I have a disk herniation and that is how it started, with a traditional Thai massage, so please do not tell me what kind of massage I need, I know my body and I know what I need and what I do not need.

By far the worst thing here is the staff's attitude.  After the massage I tried to convey to the staff that they need beds, and some other things, all the lady did was nod her head and say yes yes yes like she didn't care one bit, you know the attitude I am talking about, like yeah, we customers have no idea what we are talking about and the staff is not going to listen to one word of our complaint.  This is just very poor taste and poor service.  I was shocked that this happened at this place, as many people talk it up.  And it was recommended to me from a Thai person.

The Lao King of Lan Chang, Sai Setthathirath I or Setthavong (1534–1572), was a profound Buddhist and erected many Buddhist monuments such as Wat Xieng Thong in Luang Prabang and the Phra That Luang in Vientiane. After having moved his capital from Luang Prabang to Vientiane in the mid-16th century, King Setthathirath ordered here a stupa built over the ancient one as a demonstration of his faith. Setthathirath's pagoda became heavily damaged over the years and toppled in 1970. The stupa was renovated by the Fine Arts Department in 1976-77.

2149,6885224,"Be very careful when buying service or items from this island. There are no souvenirs - only food stuff. The island is small.
This was the last stop for my 5 island trip. The guide won't tell you exactly what is here until your near the end of the trip and are too tired and hungry to complain. They cut down the time on the other islands to allow more time here. We spent 1 hour and 10 minutes here. You need to pay for everything here: from pissing to sitting. The only 2 things free are swimming in the sea and sitting on the rocks at the far end.
The prices are expensive and everything is fixed. Be sure to ask for the price before buying something. Here's a few items they were selling:

- Rental for wooden deck (beach folding chair) - 150 baht for 2 chairs for unlimited time (until your boat calls you back)
- Coconut - 150 baht per unit
- Fruit juice - 150 baht per unit
- Lays chips (small) - 60 baht per unit
- Roasted corn - 50 baht per unit
- Toilet/restroom - 20 baht per entry per person
- Jetski - 1,200 baht per person for 20 minutes (beware the common jetski scam where they accuse you for damaging the jetski when you return it. It was already damaged/dented even before you rent it)

The place is crowded and dirty. The sellers here are not very pleasant and spend more time talking among themselves rather than paying attention to customers. The stalls close at 6.00pm.

Beware the tour agency you hire. Chances are that they have struck a deal with the sellers on the island. Mine agency was Suleman Marine.

Devotees come to pray, offer flowers, and apply gold leaf to the fingers.  It makes for memorable scenes and beautiful photos. This is undoubtedly the most photographed scene in all of Sukhothai.

2184,456350,"Sanctuary of Hypocracy? The ironies here do not stop. After being forced to take a tour, you get to hear all these positive messages about the symbolism such as respect your elders, take care of the environment, be kind to animals, and take care of your family, country, and community. Of course, good messages, but actions speak louder than words or symbols.
 You pass the shrine to Mother Earth and are told 'we all must do our part', only to walk outside to the sea and discover a mile+ long by 10meter wide floating pile of plastic and garbage in the seaside. (If they spent only a fraction less effort in paying low income laborers to clean up the sea opposed to hand chiselling shrines to Mother Earth Godesses out of Old Growth trees, that seaside would be cleaner and the message would be more than idillic words.). Not to mention supplying pottable drinking water to the people and saving millions of plastic water bottles from polluting the whole country side and ocean. 
Then you see the carving of a man rescuing a dog from a torrentially flowing river and you remember the 100's if not 1000's of stray/ferral dogs and cats sleeping on roads and dying alone of disease etc. I wont even go into the elephant riding situation found here. A sacred animal used to hold obese western tourists and walk in cicrcles in the summer heat on pavement.
Then you hear the great messages about taking care of your children and Family and then recall the girls selling themselves on Beach Road and being sold to 50+ year old white men for 'ping pong' shows. Who's children are these teenagers and where is the modo from the sanctuary in action. 
Back to 'Mother Earth' and the shrine to her. The irony here is massive but may be overlooked by the great carpentry. Up north I got to see the last lone male Gibbon in an entire region. A population destined for extirpation and possibly exiction; habitat loss and human influence would be top reasons. Here, you have a shrine to Mother Earth made out of old growth tropical hardwoods (aka gibbon habitat amongst other species such as Tigers).
Then you think, maybe this place would be nice to meditate in. But I am unsure when they will ever allow few enough people to allow for the same kind of spiritual awakening one can already find in nature such as the old Gibbon habitats and clean shores of days gone by.
This place is another tourist trap. Will make a ton of money, but not sure how many more dogs it will save, how much more in touch people will become with nature, or how many more teenage women will get engineering degrees instead of Master's Degrees in Ping-Pong shows?

2185,456350,"The Sanctuary of Truth was unlike anything I’d ever seen. It’s not just a building, it’s a living, breathing story carved into wood. Our tour guide was a walking encyclopedia of Thai mythology. He pointed out details I would have completely missed, like the way the carvings of the apsaras (heavenly dancers) were subtly different, each representing a different emotion or virtue.
 
The sheer scale of the place was overwhelming. It felt like a giant, intricate puzzle, with each piece telling a different part of the story. He explained that the Sanctuary is still under construction, and the carvings are constantly evolving. This gave the whole experience a sense of dynamism, like witnessing a work of art in progress.
 
What struck me most was the sheer dedication of the artists. He told us that every single carving is done by hand, using traditional techniques. He even showed us some of the tools they use, which were incredibly simple yet incredibly effective.
 
The Sanctuary wasn’t just about the carvings, though. It was about the atmosphere. The air was filled with the scent of incense and the sound of birdsong. You could feel a sense of peace and tranquility, even amidst the throngs of tourists.
 
I left the Sanctuary feeling like I had only scratched the surface of its secrets.

2225,1010091,"This activity looked really fun for kids, so we went out of our way to go there.  But as we entered the temple a monkey jumped on my 10 year old son's back and bit him. We ended up spending over 400 USD on rabies vaccines/doctors.   It's not kid-friendly, and at the end of the day, they are wild animals, and can't be trusted. Both my kids were screaming and in tears, the monkey was gross and it's body was wet all over.

If you REALLY want to go, I recommend wearing a thick sarong over your head/shoulders to monkey-proof yourself a bit, and then also carry a stick to shoo them away. 

It looks cool to take a few photos, but if you get bitten, and I believe that quite a few people are, it's not worth the disruption to your holiday. 

 Rabies is endemic to Thailand, and even though you have a small chance of developing rabies after a bite, you should get the vaccine,  because the disease is deadly and un-treatable.  Also, it's not just a case of getting a quick vaccination if you get bitten, it's a course of 4 vaccines, on the day of the bite, 3 days later, a week later and a month later).",1,activity looked really fun kid went way go entered temple monkey jumped year old son back bit ended spending usd rabies vaccinesdoctors kidfriendly end day wild animal cant trusted kid screaming tear monkey gross body wet really want go recommend wearing thick sarong headshoulders monkeyproof bit also carry stick shoo away look cool take photo get bitten believe quite people worth disruption holiday rabies endemic thailand even though small chance developing rabies bite get vaccine disease deadly untreatable also case getting quick vaccination get bitten course vaccine day bite day later week later month later

2230,10077750,"This expansive landscape transforms into a sea of vibrant yellow as the Bua Tong flowers bloom in profusion. With the arrival of cooler temperatures, the quiet district of Khun Yuam awakens – its tranquil air replaced by a vibrant energy that mirrors the dazzling floral display.

Peak Season: The Bua Tong flowers bloom between November and December, making this the most suitable time to visit. Plan and book your accommodation and transportation well in advance, especially during peak season, as it can get crowded.

 You can reach the area by taking a bus or van from Chiang Mai, the nearest major city. Alternatively, renting a car or motorbike provides more flexibility for exploring the surrounding areas.

The weather during the blooming season can be cool, especially in the mornings and evenings. Pack layers of clothing, including a light jacket or sweater, long pants, and comfortable shoes suitable for uneven terrain.

2231,10077750,"Sometimes Instagram-type photos can be luckily taken with perfect weather and lighting. Some of these ‘idyllic’ shots can cause over reaction in our judgement and increase anticipation. The result can be that when we actually see the object with our own eyes, the ‘real’ sight does not live up to the perceived images or our embroidered expectations.

Whilst I have been wanting to visit Thung Bua Tong Fields at Doi Mae U Kho, I was slightly concerned that this maybe a case of over expectation but was jubilant to discover that, in reality, this spectacular sight was much more that I had ever anticipated. It has left deep impressions.

From Khun Yuam on Route 108 turn up further into the mountains on route 1263 it’s a good road that twists and climbs for about 25kms. Finally, at an altitude of 1,600 meters one starts to see the yellow hillside and shortly one is surrounded by the masses of bright yellow ‘Sunflowers’.

Commonly known as the Tree Marigold the plants are from the family Asteraceae and also called Mexican Sunflowers and Nitobe chrysanthemum, amongst others. Whether they are true sunflowers or not is irrelevant as one leaves the car and is enveloped by this cornucopia of 2-meter+ tall swaying bushes of yellow delight.

The development here is quite tasteful. Yes, there is a winding road that passes through these fields, but traffic is minimal and respectful. There are a variety of trails that one can explore through the tunnels of flowers. Conveniently placed view-points afford magnificent vistas over the flowers to the surrounding mountains. Whilst there are toilets there are no commercial shops or cafes to disturb the scenery or clear alpine air.

The flowers bloom at their best sometime between the beginning of November until the second week of December. We visited on November 16th and I believe that the conditions could not have been better. One is recommended to visit either early morning or late afternoon (as we did), to enjoy the best views. It really is breath-taking, awe-inspiring, almost surreal, hypnotic and even spiritual as one attempts to absorb all that one is seeing within an aura of quietness and respect from the other visitors. 

It is a photographer’s dream, and one could probably spend 24 hours there to take in both the sunrise and the sunset. I believe that it is possible to camp, and a simple mountain resort is relatively nearby but apologies, I did not get the name 

For me it was one of the most inspirational sights that I have had the privilege to witness. I have heard it likened to the alpine meadows from the Sound of Music, but this does not do the Bua Tong Sunflower Fields justice. They are magical and we were truly so fortunate to visit when we did with the flowers in full bloom, spectacular panoramas over the mountains, a clear blue sky and few other visitors. Add this to your bucket list, no lifetime is complete without this experience.

Be careful when you visit, it would be so disappointing to arrive before the flowers are in bloom or when they are well past their best.

2291,669526,"Hailed as one of the top 10 gardens of the world. It's huge no doubt, particularly spectacular when you view it from above. But I felt it was lacking in essence. Like as if no one knew what it should be like then just plonked a couple of huge ass unrealistic statues of random things from dinosaurs to tortoises, to otters and pigs to gnomes. Then out of nowhere is a golden shrine for the Four-Faced Buddha surrounded by empty wilderness. Oh there's also a maze in there. Strolled around randomly till it was time for the 3.30pm Cultural Show in Scala Theatre and at the end of the show, the exit leads to the partial open-air amphitheatre where the Elephant Show was on, a total of 70 mins covering both.

The Cultural Show is a showcase of Thai culture, from dancing to drums to performances for festivities prayers and rites. I particularly enjoyed the segment where they depicted a scene from wars in the past, where warriors fought on elephants. Never imagined they would bring in live elephants into an enclosed air-conditioned theatre. 

From Thai dances, it later became a showcase of dances from around the world such as Brazilian Samba to Indian to Chinese dance. Kind of odd I say. I rather they put on some display of Muay Thai instead.

The Elephant Show was more interesting. One could pay THB100 for photos with the elephants, and I'm impressed by the animal's intelligence. There were tourists tipping them, giving them cash which they took over with their trunks and then passing to their minder. Visitors can also buy bananas to feed them, which they also took over with their trunks and stuff straight into their mouths. I wonder how they differentiated what can eat and what cannot since they were just taking whatever the visitors were giving them with their trunks. 

The show was a further display of their intelligence, from shooting darts at balloons to painting (on t-shirts that were put up for sale after too), to playing football and basketball to back massages for volunteers from the audience.",4,hailed one top garden world huge doubt particularly spectacular view felt lacking essence like one knew like plonked couple huge as unrealistic statue random thing dinosaur tortoise otter pig gnome nowhere golden shrine fourfaced buddha surrounded empty wilderness oh there also maze strolled around randomly till time pm cultural show scala theatre end show exit lead partial openair amphitheatre elephant show total min covering cultural show showcase thai culture dancing drum performance festivity prayer rite particularly enjoyed segment depicted scene war past warrior fought elephant never imagined would bring live elephant enclosed airconditioned theatre thai dance later became showcase dance around world brazilian samba indian chinese dance kind odd say rather put display muay thai instead elephant show interesting one could pay thb photo elephant im impressed animal intelligence tourist tipping giving cash took trunk passing minder visitor also buy banana feed also took trunk stuff straight mouth wonder differentiated eat since taking whatever visitor giving trunk show display intelligence shooting dart balloon painting tshirts put sale playing football basketball back massage volunteer audience

The speed boats used in the tour looked old and beaten down. One of the boats used in the tour was irresponsibly piloted at high speeds when the boat was dangerously jumping in the air, making all the tourists in the boat uncomfortable. They kept changing boats throughout the day. And the water activities, for which we paid a lot, were all a scam. There was a one-hour wait standing in line for the parasailing activity. But the activity itself was over in under two minutes. Then the banana boat ride - paid in all 1200 Baht for 4 persons. That banana boat ride lasted only 30 seconds. They made us sit on the banana boat, took our picture, pulled the boat into the water, and immediately brought it back. The ride was over in 30 seconds. On Pattaya beach, a 1200 Baht banana boat ride will last for 30 minutes. This was my last tour with Klook. Never again.

It is a secluded stretch of beach in a cove with golden sands, flanked at both ends by dramatic headland with cliffs and washed by the water's of the Andaman Sea. 

Like the other beaches there are no facilities here, sunbeds or umbrellas. The only shade here is provided by the cliffs and some trees along the beach.

There are no shops, restaurants or bars here, so for those visitors intending to spend some time here, everything required for the stay if brought with you. 

One of the features on the beach is the Pai Plong Floating Pier, which we walked along to the end. From the Pier it was the nearest we got on land to the  impressive Ao Nang Tower,  some wonderful views. 

Nearby the Pier there are some canoes for hire. It is possible to purchase a day pass to use the facilities of the Hotel, no idea how much this costs.

How the walkways were built clinging to the rock mountainside is astounding and something of a modern marvel.  There are seven levels in all, entailing a climb of around 750 steps.  It will seem difficult initially, but the stairs are quite easy to manage; the most difficult for me was reaching the very top (level 7), from which the views are stunning.

Actually, I would elevate it to being one of Thailand's greatest (albeit a bit off the beaten path for some) sightseeing attractions.

I reckon you also categorise a visit here, under the umbrella of adventure tourism.

Well it was not an easy ascent, to be honest, it was a bit harum-scarum, along the way up, in some sections of the path.

It is always great to make it to the top and the panoramic views were worth it. 😎

However, getting back down, well at times, I felt genuinely anxious. 

I made it (of course) and was rewarded with a relaxing time spent in the lush botanical gardens, as well as checking out even more of the impressive grounds and surrounds that lay at the base of the temple complex.

There are walkways made of wooden planks on two separate levels that go one entire round around the mountain. The walkway is quite broad, not too narrow to walk so it is quite an enjoyable walk to view the scenery of the surrounding countryside. But be careful of some areas where there may be big rocks jutting out from the walls of the mountain. 

On the 5th level, there is also a small temple with a large rock on its roof. There is a walkway to go over from the mountain. 

You will be able to see a temple which has a number of statues on a level that is halfway up the mountain.

We got to the cave site and found no one there (second surprise!). There is only one park ranger/guide at the site, so if he is taking another group through the cave, you have to wait. We called back to our hotel to confirm this, and waited about 15 minutes for the guide and group to re-emerge. Once inside, we were rewarded with a very unique cave experience for SE Asia. The only light to view the formations was from the guide's flashlight, which gave us a much different experience than caves that are continuously lit. I suppose you could bring additional flashlights, but we liked the effect of the guide directing our sight (I tried my phone flashlight for a minute or so, not enough power to make a difference). Our guide (and his helpful dog) took us through for about 20 minutes, and also showed us the bats and crickets that inhabit the cave.

I've been to Thailand a number of times and have – of course – visited some temples, of which there are many(!). More often than not I find them a bit too crowded and sometimes also a bit exaggerated (at least to my somewhat austere taste). This place is different, however. Two colours stand out: brown/chestnut and gold and lend an air of calm, quiet and solemnity to the scene once you come into the temple. It had the effect on me, that I actually sat down and tried to meditate for a little while. This place is actually a soothing place to stay, and I had willingly stayed longer, had I not had obligations to the rest of my party to attend to. 
There's a good place to refresh yourself close by (Ban Suan Nim Ram) with reasonably priced food, and cottages too, if you want to stay in the area for longer. The scenery is also quite amazing.

2487,4322746,"Friday 19th January and we took a long-tailed boat from Ao Nang to Railay Beach. From there we walked to East Railay and then on to Phra Nang Beach where this Cave is located at one end of the beach and Ko Rang Nok tower at the other.

This is the second of two caves along the headland both have rather unusal shrines in them. However this is larger of the two caves, as result has more contents inside it.

There was a bit of confusion and no clear information about the names of the Cave. For the purposes of this review, this one is Phra Nang Cave and the smaller one is Princess Cave.

Having visited the smaller cave first we were neither surprised nor shocked to see the contents of this Cave and it's shrine.

A statue of Phra Nang sits on a table, with legs crossed, holding  a bowl in front of her. The Shrine is surrounded by colourful floral tributes and pieces of cloth. There are two smaller statues perched behind Phra Nang, one on either side of her.

Around the cave there are vast numbers of wooden phalluses, erect penises, in all shapes and sizes and painted in different colours and embedded in the sand. There is a pile, towards the rear of the Cave of discarded phalluses. 

The Cave is a sacred place and should be treated with respect by visitors. Fishermen and boatmen come here  to make floral  offerings and burn incense ensuring a safe return journey from sea.

There is a sign requesting that visitors do not leave the following five items for Phra Nang as  ""she is Indian, not a God and she believes in the phallus or Ungam as a symbol of the Hindu God Shiva"".

The items are sex toys, red water, red flowers, traditional Thai costumes or strange offerings.

There are many legend and myths about who Phra Nang was, one is she was an Indian princess who was killed in a shipwreck nearby and her ghost occupies the cave.

Another story says that Phra Nang was the wife of a local fisherman, whose husband was lost at sea and she lived her life in the cave waiting for his return. 

Fishermen and boatmen still make offerings in the form of incense and flowers to ensure a safe journey. They believe that Phra Nang, Princess Goddess lives in the Cave under the cliff

2498,3445712,"The Khao Mai Kaew cave was an interesting and challenging trip for me personally. To get there, we had to go through the jungle/forest, climbing a couple of sets of roughly made ladders. I am about 1.55m (on a good day) and some of the rungs of the ladder were quite widely spaced that I had to stretch pretty high up. We had to pull ourselves up with ropes on a few other occasions. 

We had a ten minutes break from the hike up before we entered the cave. The interior of the cave itself was superb. Some parts were slippery, others were just small openings we had to squeeze through. It was a tough climb up to the cave and a challenging one inside, so honestly, I was not fully able to enjoy the wonders of the cave.

It was an overall a superb experience. What I don't recommend is for small children (in age or stature), or anyone with respiratory issues (cos once you are deeper into the cave, breathing can be difficult.), or those whose stamina is not up to par (like moi) to participate in this activity.

Total ascent time took about 2.5 hours at a slow pace with regular stops and descent was 2 hours. I'd say difficulty level is only 3 out of 5 (as an experienced hiker), with the first 75% a gentle slope but lots of crossing through the steams (you will get wet up to knee or waist height) and the final 25% quite a steep ascent, often needing to use your hands. Care needs to be taken as the path gets wet and can be quite slippery.

One attraction here is the pink, champagne mushrooms (poisonous) which are quite beautiful. Then it's kwok e-dok waterfall itself which is quite a magnificent site but also fun to play in the pools (but a bit cold). Do take care as this is still quite a natural and undisturbed attraction.

2520,6669305,"When people think of ""national parks"" they normally except something exceptional.  The only things exceptional about Nam Tok Sam Lan National Park are the poor management and the excessive charges.  We usually don't complain about the dual-prices practices at Thai national parks, but in the case of this park there shouldn't be any charges for Thais or foreigners as the services and features are so limited.  The charge of 100 baht for foreigners, plus 30 baht for vehicles to enter, is frankly unwarranted.

Aside from the immediate area around the small reservoir where camping is allowed, there are almost no areas for visitors.  The short 300-meter trail to the main waterfall is poorly maintained.  The tiers of the waterfall are actually manmade, with rocks cemented into place in a very unnatural manner.  

We planned our visit during the rainy season, expecting that it would be the time when there might be some nice views.  Disappointingly, there was absolutely no water flowing over the ""falls"".  There were a lot of birds and butterflies, however, which were the only attractive things about the park.

Park officials also aggressively prevented us from going to the opposite side of the reservoir (what are they hiding or protecting?).  So, the entire park visit consisted of a drive up an asphalt road of less than a kilometer and a 300-meter hike to a non-existent waterfall.",2,people think national park normally except something exceptional thing exceptional nam tok sam lan national park poor management excessive charge usually dont complain dualprices practice thai national park case park shouldnt charge thai foreigner service feature limited charge baht foreigner plus baht vehicle enter frankly unwarranted aside immediate area around small reservoir camping allowed almost area visitor short meter trail main waterfall poorly maintained tier waterfall actually manmade rock cemented place unnatural manner planned visit rainy season expecting would time might nice view disappointingly absolutely water flowing fall lot bird butterfly however attractive thing park park official also aggressively prevented u going opposite side reservoir hiding protecting entire park visit consisted drive asphalt road less kilometer meter hike nonexistent waterfall

2523,455766,"There are many parts to this national park, not just the famous Phraya Nakhon Cave. Once you pay the 200 thb entry fee, you can visit all sections of the park without extra charge. If you come from Hua Hin, I would recommend this itinerary: First visit Phraya Nakhon Cave, as it's the main attraction. Then if you have any energy left, you can drive to the southernmost part of the park to the visitor center. Here is a short boardwalk leading you through the mangroves. Takes about 15 minutes to walk the circular route. Dusky leaf monkeys can be seen. They also have interesting information about the park, and clean toilets. Not worth a special trip here, but once you have driven to the cave, this is not much farther. Then I suggest driving to Sam Phraya Beach. Spend an hour or two enjoying an empty beach in a very scenic location. More clean toilets, and a good place to eat lunch. This beach, in my opinion, is worth a special trip if you plan to spend the day, or the night (they have houses to rent, or you can camp). Very peaceful. Lastly, you can stop at Sai Cave. Sai cave isn't worth a special trip, but again, if you've come this far you might as well see the cave. Not the best toilets here. From there it's an hour's drive back to Hua Hin, a full day.

2540,2086145,"We visited the national park in early January when the conditions were very dry. We were a party of 5 aged 11, 18, 38, 65 and 75. We were dropped off at the Ton Sai side and hiked the 5 miles to the other side. We asked for a guide on arrival and were offered it at a cost of 500THB each (after also paying the 200THB per adult and 100THB per child) but we negotiated it to 1,500THB. It took us somewhere just under 3 hours and we were glad we had a lot of water with us. I wouldn’t say it was a very challenging hike so long as you are reasonably fit but the heat and humidity does add difficulty. There were some parts that were very steep and some parts which were quite tricky to navigate. We certainly would have struggled to find our way without a guide but I would describe him as sat nav more than a guide. He didn’t point anything out to us or assist with navigating tricky parts of the path. Both of my parents fell (65yo and 75yo) at separate points and he didn’t come to their assistance at all. 
We saw one small snake on the path and some butterflies…no other wildlife. I would recommend this hike if you particularly like hiking through jungle but there’s not much else on offer so far as sights. If you want the sights then visit the Bang Pae side and visit the waterfall there. It takes about ten minutes to get to it from the car park.

It is an interesting concept which showcases ceramic art in an innovative way. However, the whole temple is sadly neglected and maintenance issues are visible everywhere.

The lady there said she had done the cave once but wouldn't do it again and just smiled.  I knew we had to lie down in the boat.  We entered the cave with 2 of us in the boat plus the 2 boatmen.  On entering we had to lie down as the ceiling of the cave was about a foot to 18 inches above our heads.  This was only for a very brief time.  We then entered a larger chamber and eventually docked the boat and got out and walked through some of the cave.  Very nice I thought.  Then we got back into the boat and instead of exiting the way we had come in we went out a different way.  This is when it got really interesting.  We had to lie down in the boat and the space between my nose and the ceiling kept shrinking until it was only an inch or less.  A couple of times the boat scraped the sides of the cave and seemed to become stuck.  There was much  chattering in Thai between the boatmen and then they gave a mighty push on the ceiling and the boat went down in the water, shot forward and popped up all the time with my nose almost scraping the top of the cave.  It was somewhat terrifying as you really were unable to move at all or do anything.  I kept telling myself that the guys in the boat do this every day and I am sure we will eventually get out. I am unsure as to exactly how long it took to eventually get to a place where the ceiling was higher and we were able to sit up and eventually exit the cave but it probably was about 20 minutes although it seemed to take forever.

2764,3915425,"We participated in the 2-day, 1-night Nature Lover Tour.

The first day was quite enjoyable. We saw many animals, and the day was exciting. Deaw seemed to be a good guide.

In the afternoon, we embarked on a ""night safari,"" which involved riding in the back of a car with a person who used a flashlight to point at trees, ostensibly to spot animals. However, the car moved quite quickly, making it doubtful how effective the flashlight was at such speeds. Then, it started raining heavily. I asked the staff to stop, but they did not. When the rain ceased and we started to enjoy the ""night safari"" again, we returned to the pickup point 15 minutes before the activity was scheduled to end. I wonder why...

On the morning of the second day, we discovered that Deaw had decided to start a tour with another group. It seemed he wanted to optimize his earnings and therefore assigned us another guide. Initially, we regretted not being with Deaw, as we had become familiar with him. However, we understood the situation and decided to give the new guide a chance.

The trek itself was enjoyable but lasted only about 1 hour and 30 minutes. The guide mentioned we were walking quite fast and had us lead the group instead of guiding us himself. By 12:00 PM, we had arrived at the central part of the park. We asked the guide about additional activities we could do until lunchtime, but he responded with, ""I don't know."" When we mentioned we had paid for a private tour and expected a private guide, he seemed surprised, asking, ""You paid me?!""

At that point, we learned that the guide would leave us, and we would spend the rest of the day on our own, receiving only transfers between locations. This was completely disappointing. We ended up doing activities we could have done independently by renting a motorcycle, without any guidance or explanations. Essentially, we visited several unremarkable waterfalls with no added value.

Deaw, when offering a private tour, there should be a minimum standard of service. Unfortunately, the second day fell short of our expectations. While we were satisfied with the first day of the tour, the second day was the opposite.

Additionally, one of the reasons we booked this tour was because of the activities listed on your website, many of which did not take place. It seems you cannot trust what the website advertises.

I understand that others might have enjoyed this tour, but the uncertainty of what Deaw feels like doing with your tour is not worth the price.

For all these reasons, I would not recommend this tour.",1,participated day night nature lover tour first day quite enjoyable saw many animal day exciting deaw seemed good guide afternoon embarked night safari involved riding back car person used flashlight point tree ostensibly spot animal however car moved quite quickly making doubtful effective flashlight speed started raining heavily asked staff stop rain ceased started enjoy night safari returned pickup point minute activity scheduled end wonder morning second day discovered deaw decided start tour another group seemed wanted optimize earnings therefore assigned u another guide initially regretted deaw become familiar however understood situation decided give new guide chance trek enjoyable lasted hour minute guide mentioned walking quite fast u lead group instead guiding u pm arrived central part park asked guide additional activity could lunchtime responded dont know mentioned paid private tour expected private guide seemed surprised asking paid point learned guide would leave u would spend rest day receiving transfer location completely disappointing ended activity could done independently renting motorcycle without guidance explanation essentially visited several unremarkable waterfall added value deaw offering private tour minimum standard service unfortunately second day fell short expectation satisfied first day tour second day opposite additionally one reason booked tour activity listed website many take place seems trust website advertises understand others might enjoyed tour uncertainty deaw feel like tour worth price reason would recommend tour

2854,8064645,"Chulabhorn Dam (เขื่อนจุฬาภรณ์) is a dam in Tambon Thung Lui Lai, Amphoe Kon San, Chaiyaphum Province, Thailand. It impounds the Phrom River, a tributary 
of the Mekong. The dam has diverted the Nam Phrong River. As water leaves its turbines, it empties into the Choen River. The dam is named after 
Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, of Thailand.  Chulabhorn dam, or formerly Nam Phrom dam, was built across the Nam Phrom River at an area known as Phu 
Yuak on the Khun Phai Mountain in Khon San district, Chaiyaphum province. Its reservoir is also a breeding source of fresh-water fish.  Typical to Thai dams, the Chulabhorn Dam is an earth core rockfill dam. Its function is to 
generate electricity and to irrigate riparian agriculture. The dam is 700 m (2,300 ft) long and 70 m (230 ft) high. Its reservoir covers 31 km2 (12 sq mi). The power house is located at the dam. The power house contains two turbines, each with a 
capacity of 20,000 KW. Total annual energy production is 59 Gwh.
Like the Pak Mun Dam downstream, the Chulabhorn has not been without its share of controversies.  These have principally been over the way in which 
water is allocated for irrigation vis-a-vis power generation; and over the diversion of water from the Nam Phong to the Choen River, depriving downstream 
communities along the Choen. Downstream of the Chulabhorn Dam, along the Choen River, lie three districts: Kaset Sombun, Ban Thaen and Phu Khieo. 
The reduced flows of the Choen has caused villagers to come together and try to persuade EGAT to increase the amount of water. This protest started 
in 1973, and has earned these villagers the title of the ""water beggars of the Northeast"".  Boat rentals are available to view the sights of the reservoir, and there are various attractions around the dam. lts lake-like reservoir provides 
beautiful scenery and surroundings. There are bungalows and restaurants in the area. There is a sightseeing point above the dam with the Temperate 
Plants Experimental Centre and observatory are also located there.
Tourist attractions within the Chulabhorn Dam are as follows:
The Replica of Phra Phutthasiri Sakkharat (Luangpho Chet Kasat) is a revered Buddha image enshrined at the left side of the upstream dam, opposite Chulabhorn Dam’s Park.
Chulabhorn Dam’s Parkcovers an area of approximately 41 rai, decorated as a preserved forest with various kinds of plants. There is also a Phrom Phitsamai pavilion for relaxation. The path through the park is paved with natural stones.
The 325-Million-Years Ancient Plants are in the similar category of grass, comprising two main species: namely, Son Sam Roi Yot (Lycopodium) and Son Hang Ma or Ya Thot Plong (Horsetail or Equisetum).

2890,455348,"The park is a must if you are interested in the history of Thailand.  If you have seen Ayutthia then you must also see Sukhothai.  It predates Ayutthia and is historically important.  Although there has been much reconstruction, the main park is very interesting.  The park is divided into to three areas each with its own ticketing.  Most people only do the main park as it is the easiest to access.  
It is best to stay in accommodation in Old Sukhothai, as then it is just a walk to the park or you can hire a bicycle or buggy to get around.  It would be hot and difficult to walk around the park , especially after 9.00am. 

 We stayed in the History cafe which is an old wooden house run by a delightful old man but it was not the accommodation for us as it had steep steps and the bathroom facilities were inadequate.   It would suit younger people.  However there are more expensive  and suitable accommodations around.

Staying in New Sukhothai unless you had your own transport, is tedious with the long travel and additional expense.  

In old Sukhothai you walk or bike to the park  and hire an electric buggy 200B per hour (hire for two hours from the outset) from one of three sites outside the park.  The park also arranges tuk tuks and cute car buggies (not for large people).  The latter are squishy and more expensive than the more comfortable and larger buggies.  You are given a laminated map (better than the paper one given with the ticket).  The buggies have a place for your drink and you can leave bags (at your peril on busy days) in the buggy.  

 The ticket purchased from the ticket office is 100B per person (with thin paper map) and checked at the gate and at one other point in the park.  There are toilets and drink points within the park.  

You will spend a significant amount of the 1st hour at the Palace complex hence the need to hire for more than 1 hour at the outset.  If you hire only for 1 hour and more than 10 mins over the next hour on the return, you are charged for the next full hour.

The paths are easy to drive on and you park outside each site and walk on to the site.  Remember than you must obey the signs which tell you not to climb on the monuments.  

In some sites there are photographic records of the reconstruction that has been done.  Not restoration but reconstruction.

You have to bike or hire separate transport (tuk tuk (300B per hour)) to see the northern monuments.  It is a slow and awkward ride.  The tuk tuks are not made for Europeans and the ceilings are low, the side bench seats narrow and you have to watch your head getting in and our of the vehicle and can miss your footing on the small and narrow step.  More than three people in the tuk tuk and you have no where to put your legs!

Where the main park has some flowering plants, the other sites do not, and are very dry and dusty.

Getting to Sukhothai from Bangkok was done via Bangkok Airways and a van transfer 300B per person from the tiny airport.

I wanted to describe how to get there because the directions I saw on line were poor. If you are in Patong go south on hi-way 4030. It's just the main road out of the city. Pass thru Karon and Kata and head toward Nui Beach. You will pass Karon Viewpoint hard to miss. Then, in about another 300 yards after Karon View will be the entrance to Nui Beach. At the entrance will be taxis and rides up there. You can take your scooter or whatever you have and do the drive yourself. 

The road is pretty bad in many spots but not terrible. After roughly a kilometer there will be a bend in the road to the left and going straight is the decent to Nui beach. This is where I park my scooter. Take the bend left and it's about 500 meters a little uphill not too steep. You will come to a black rock that says Pa Hin Dum.

The opposite side of the road is another sign, in Thai, that has an arrow pointing up a trail. There is also a worn, faded very faded flag. Take this trail. It's about 200 meters and pretty built up with some railing and a rest spot at one point. Soon you will reach the top and see an incredible view.

Fair warning there is another trail behind a white bucket at the top. I went about 100 yards down this trail thinking it led to another view point.

The old city here in the area has an old ancient deep moat, and there should be many more ancient things buried here in the area yet waiting to be discovered. There is no fee for entry, and a small temple grounds are nearby. It was a little hard to find, as we asked around with many locals.

3011,4322915,"As Thai Buddhist temples go, Wat Khae is very ordinary and is not worth a visit.

However, it was mentioned in the Thai classical poem, ""Khun Chang Khum Phaen"", which is still widely read today.  As a consequence the temple has established a park alongside the temple commemorating the poem.

This epic poem which has its roots in Thai folklore, is one of the most important works in Thai literature.   Chang and Phaen are the leading male characters involved in a classical love triangle, competing for the hand of Wanthong.  Their 50 year struggle to win her hand involves abductions, revolts, court cases, trial by ordeal, jail and treachery and the poem is full of heroism, romance, sex, violence, custard-pie comedy, magic and horror.

In the end the king condemns Wanthong to death for failing to choose between the two men.

Every schoolchild in Thailand learns passages from the poem, and it is the source of many songs, popular sayings and metaphors.

The park is home to an enormous, giant tamarind tree, which according to local legend, is the tamarind tree mentioned in the poem, where Phaen is taught how to magically turn tamarind leaves into wasps.  There is a large notice alongside it declaring it to be one of the ""Trees of Thailand"" and is under Royal protection.",4,thai buddhist temple go wat khae ordinary worth visit however mentioned thai classical poem khun chang khum phaen still widely read today consequence temple established park alongside temple commemorating poem epic poem root thai folklore one important work thai literature chang phaen leading male character involved classical love triangle competing hand wanthong year struggle win hand involves abduction revolt court case trial ordeal jail treachery poem full heroism romance sex violence custardpie comedy magic horror end king condemns wanthong death failing choose two men every schoolchild thailand learns passage poem source many song popular saying metaphor park home enormous giant tamarind tree according local legend tamarind tree mentioned poem phaen taught magically turn tamarind leaf wasp large notice alongside declaring one tree thailand royal protection

The penises, hundreds of them tied with bows or draped with necklaces, are stacked in big shameless piles next to the canal. The origins of the shrine are murky. It seems to have been the creation of a Thai businessman who used to own the property back in the early years of the 20th century.

Besides the carved penises that come in a variety of styles and sizes, visitors have left behind all sorts of offerings: bowls of fruit, bottles of red Fanta soda, and even a few elegant silk dresses in plastic dry cleaning bags hung from the banyan trees.

A good number of the folks who visit the shrine are couples hoping to get pregnant.

These hold about 40-50 passengers, have dubious safety equipment, unreliable timetables but zoom down the canal at breakneck speeds. Whilst they have plastic tarpaulins you are fairly low to the water and always face the possibility of getting wet from the spray.

The other alternative is the tourist hop on/hop off boats which run from Pratunam (bear the Central World Plaza) and Panfa Leelard, just behind the Mahakan Fort, at Phanfa Bridge. These are more expensive, but cheaper and quicker than a taxi, they give you the same experience as the local klorng boats but at a more leisurely and safer speed.

3068,3838054,"The Khlong Saen Saep Express Boat, like so much that's great about Bangkok, is 100% impossible to imagine in the U.S. It's a long, skinny speed boat that churns through the unsavory waters of the Saen Saep Canal, spraying its passengers with a fine mist of whatever it is the water is full of. 

Don't expect the boat to pull gently up to the pier to allow people to embark or disembark. That's not its style. Instead, the kamikaze pilot at the helm zips along the canal at full throttle. At the last possible second, he throws the engine in reverse and careens into the pier. As the engine screams and fills the air with diesel smoke, passengers scramble on and off, desperately trying not to get crushed between the boat and the dock, or worse, fall into the canal. 

A kid wearing a crash helmet clambers around the outside of the boat, pulling himself along by a couple ropes while he sells tickets to the passengers who've hopped aboard. In the past, the deckhand didn't have to wear a helmet. But then the boat operators decided to get serious about safety. 

I decide to take the Khlong Saen Saep Express Boat out to Witthayu Road because unless you have a helicopter it's definitely the fastest way to get across town. As we pick up speed, a local guy sitting in front of me pulls up the plastic tarp that's supposed to protect us from the spray. An American tourist sitting next to him notices.

3104,6277153,"The cave entrance is up a long staircase from the parking lot which has clean toilets. There is a lady renting flashlights at the mouth of the cave and it's a good idea to get one to help see inside better.  There are lights in place already and stairways to make going up and down safe if strenuous.  There are two places which require squeezing around rocks, the one just inside is the most difficult.  Once past there you are fine.  The steps descend down through several large chambers with interesting formations and Buddha images. It took about half an hour to see it all.  To exit, you climb back up the steps the way you descended.   There is occasionally a band of monkeys that roams through the parking lot where you can buy food to toss to them.

3105,1368429,"The Mae Hong Son Loop is a beautiful route in Northern Thailand.
Popular amongst bikers and tourists because of the amazing roads with stunning viewpoints.

I can't even tell how many times I did the loop, probably about 7+ times,and I would do it all over again. And again.
It's the feeling of freedom to wander where you want, on not such a strict schedule.

Is it dangerous, some ask.
Be responsible while driving, stay in your own lane and watch out for oncoming traffic, because sometimes they might be on your side of the road.
How about the curves?
Some of them are hairpin curves which can be quite steep.
How to know if you are able to ride such a curve?
As an example you could take a trip to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai. Just before arriving to the 300 steps stairs, there is a hairpin curve with some steepness to it. Now you can determine yourself if you are able to conquer this curve and the curves along the Mae Hong Son Loop.

Back to the Mae Hong Son Loop with some tips, do's and don'ts.
When it comes to clockwise or counter clockwise direction, there is no right or wrong. However, I prefer clockwise because it seems in this direction the loop gets only better and better.
For this ride you might need 5/6 days. No rush, take it easy and enjoy every moment.

After a few days sightseeing in Chiang Mai, it's time to start the loop.
Make sure you have a (big) bike with at least 155cc.
My favourite ride is a Yamaha Aerox 155cc.
This is an automatic bike which has enough power to get you through the loop.
Leave some luggage behind in your Chiang Mai hotel if you have too much.
During the loop comfort is essential, so have a lightweight backpack on and leave some space for groceries on the way.
Always pack a raincoat (or 2, two bottles of water and a jacket. A jacket? Yes, it can be cold up there in the mountains!

Leave Chiang Mai City when it starts to get light outside. There is a long drive ahead. Follow road 108 for 63km and turn right into road 1009 to Doi Inthanon National Park. From road 1009 to the summit is about 50km.
This park is famous for it’s highest point of Thailand, waterfalls, the 2 pagoda’s and it’s garden. At the entrance of the national park you pay an entrance fee for yourself and your bike.
Personally I have 3 stops in this park. The first one is the Wachirathan Waterfall. This is 80m high waterfall and the biggest in this park.
The next stop are the 2 pagoda’s. It’s easy to miss while you drive, so keep your eyes open. You’ll see some parkingspots on the left side of the road with a steep road between them, which is the entrance.
Park your bike and start walking up the steep road, or get the shuttle if available. The 2 pagoda’s honor the late king and queen of Thailand.
These pagoda’s are stunning, surrounded by a beautiful garden and amazing views if the weather is good.
Now the last stop is the highest point of Thailand, which is only 6km away from the pagoda’s. Now the anti climax is that the highest point of Thailand is surrounded by trees, so not much of a view.
Some people like to arrange accomodation in or near the park to enjoy the sunrise which they view from a once of the turns or from the pagoda’s.
It’s time to hit the road and leave the National Park.
Going back to road 108 and follow this road for 135km to Mae Sariang.
Mae Sariang is a city not far from Myanmar.
There is not much to see in this city, but rest is needed since the drive was about 290km in total.
A recommended hotel is Above The Sea Boutique hotel. There is not much
choice when it comes to hotels, but this is the best one. It has rooms in loft style and one of the softest beds I’ve ever tried.
Drop your stuff in the room, have a shower and go for a Khao Soi,
a famous soup in the northern part of Thailand.
After a ride like today and a nice meal, you sure need a good rest.

The second day of the loop is also recommended to leave after breakfast,
Above The Sea Boutique Hotel offers you different options of breakfast.
The drive will be continued on road 108 for 165km to Mae Hong Son.
This doesn’t seem far, but there are many curves tob e conquered.
From Mae Sariang to Mae Hong Son you will see some changes in nature
and here and there some viewpoints will popup.
Get off your bike, grab a drink and enjoy some of the views you see a long the way. Have a stop at these viewpoints such as Mae La Luang Viewpoint with it’s soft rounded hills or Pha Bong Viewpoint with it’s view of huge mountains.
After 165km you arrive in Mae Hong Son City.
My recommended hotel is B2 Mae Hong Son Premier Resort.
This hotel is not far away from the center, but it’s located at a quiet spot.
It’s a good idea to stay here for 2 nights.
Wake up early the next day, very early. Grab the bike, buy some coffee and a bite at 7-11 and hit road 1095 for about 15km, where you then turn left into road 4001 for 25km until you arrive at the Pang Oung Lake. This is a beautiful lake, which is a project of the late King Bhumibol to restore forests and ecosystems. And if you are early enough, you can see the fog floating on the water. Sit down and enjoy the view with your breakfast you bought at 7-11.
Continue on road 4001 for 13km and you will arrive at Ban Rak Thai.
This is a village not far from the Myanmar border built in Yunnanese style.
In the middle of the village there is a lake, which also has the morning fog
over the water. You may want to choose where you want to enjoy the
morning fog, in Pang Oung Lake or Ban Rak Thai.
It’s only viewable in the morning for a short period of time.
By the time you arrive at the second destination, there won’t be morning fog to be seen anymore.
Be careful, because the road to these 2 destinations is very steep and has a
lot of curves.
From Ban Rak Thai on road 4001 going back for 28km, going back on road 1095 (which becomes road 108) for 20km, you arrive at a temple on a mountain called Wat Phra That Doi Kongmu.
This temple shows you a great view of the city of Mae Hong Son.
You can even see the airport from here.
There is a coffeeshop located next to the temple, have a seat, have a drink and enjoy the view.
When you’re on the way back to the hotel, stop by the Cafe Station or MHS Chamber of Commerce. At both of these places you’ll be able to get yourself a certificate for doing the Mae Hong Son Loop. A very nice souvenir!
After you have returned in your hotel and enjoyed a nice shower,
it is recommended to get out in the evening and visit the lake in the city center, named Chong Kham.
This lake is surrounded by a temple, named Wat Chong Kham and a night market. Time for a nice dinner next to the lake with a view of the temple.
After such a day full of activities, it’s time to hit the sheets.

The next day awaits a trip to the city of Pai. Follow road 108/1095 for 105km.
This route has countless curves. Be careful, but enjoy it!
You will pass a bamboo bridge named Su Tong Pae Bridge after 12km on the road. This bridge is meant for monks, so they wouldn’t have to walk in the rice fields. After 10km on the road you will arrive at the fish cave, named Tham Pla.
Personally I am not into caves so I rather move on.
Along the way on road 1095 you arrive at the Pang Mapha viewpoint.
Beautiful view, if the weather allows it, and some stalls around for a drink and
a small bite. From this viewpoint it’s about 10km on road 1095 turning into 1226 going to Ban Jabo, if you are interested.
This is a Lahu tribe village with some beautiful views.
Another viewpoint along the main road is Doi Kiew Lom Viewpoint.
This is the viewpoint which has a view from both sides of the road,
there is a giant swing and ofcourse some stalls around for your appetite.
So after in total 105km you arrive in Pai. It will probably be late in the afternoon.
My recommended hotel in Pai is the Ai Pai Hotel.
It’s one of the most expensive hotels in Pai, but has amazing beds and is
around the corner of the famous walking street.
It’s recommended to stay for 2 nights, so you have a whole day to spend
in Pai.
Have a refreshing shower and head into the walking street. From the Ai Pai Hotel it’s less than 30 seconds and you’ll be in the walking street.
There is a very laid back vibe and so much to see..and eat.
The next morning it’s time to grab the bike and drive 5km on road 1095 and head out to the Big White Buddha. Park your bike and have a morning workout walking up the stairs to the Buddha. Don’t forget a bottle of water, you’ll need it! Once up there, you’ll have a view of the city, if there isn’t too much fog.
4km away on road 1095 and you arrive at the Pai Canyon.
Park your bike next to the road and have a walk up Pai Canyon.
It has some beautiful views, but try not to be there midday, because it can be hot. Some people like to enjoy the sunset at that spot.
There is also another good spot to enjoy the sunset while having a bite and a drink, which is Two Huts Pai. From the White Buddha it’s only 6km away.
After sunset the walking street is waiting for the evening meal.

The next day is the last day of the Mae Hong Son Loop.The route goes on road 1095/107 from Pai back to Chiang Mai.
Don’t forget to take a picture or selfie at the “I AM PAI” sign.
You’ll pass the Pai Canyon again on the way back, and just after the Pai Canyon you will see the Tha Pai Memorial Bridge. In the past this bridge was used to bring trees from the jungle to Pai.
In 1944 the Japanese Army burned down the bridge and at the end of the war it was rebuilt.
Along the curvy road you will pass a viewpoint named Rak Chang.
Not much of a view, but there is a coffeeshop, and you might need a refreshment during conquering this road.
60km away from Chiang Mai there is a small waterfall named Mok Fa.
It’s not too big, but it’s on the road to our destination, so why not.
Back on the road you will notice that traffic increases, trafficjams, shoppingmalls, noise, tourists…and after about 700km, 5 nights and 6 days you’re back in Chiang Mai.

Now this is just an example how to do the Mae Hong Son Loop.
You could do it counter clockwise, stay for more or less nights, have more or less stops; it’s all up to you.
One thing is guaranteed when you do this loop, you’ll experience freedom and Thai hospitality.
Oh, and don’t forget wear a helmet!

3107,1368429,"Riding the Mae Hong Son Loop in Thailand is truly an unforgettable experience. The scenic route takes you through stunning mountain landscapes, quaint villages, and picturesque temples. As you wind your way through the lush greenery, you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the natural beauty that surrounds you.

One of the highlights of the trip is the opportunity to visit local hill tribes and learn about their culture and way of life. The people are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and it's a great chance to gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Thailand.

The roads themselves are a bit challenging at times, with steep inclines and hairpin turns, but they're well worth the effort. The feeling of freedom and exhilaration as you navigate the winding roads is indescribable.

Along the way, there are plenty of places to stop and take in the stunning views, enjoy a delicious meal, or relax at a hot spring. Each stop offers its own unique charm, and it's hard to pick a favorite.

Overall, riding the Mae Hong Son Loop is an incredible adventure that should be on every traveler's bucket list. It's an opportunity to experience the beauty and culture of Thailand in a way that few other experiences can match. Highly recommended!

3108,1368429,"As a keen biker, I was excited to experience the breathtaking scenery of northern Thailand while negotiating one of the best and most challenging road routes in the world. 
Research suggested that going during burning season should be done with a face mask, and that some of the more spectacular views would be somewhat obscured. But none of those blogs explicitly stated not to do the loop during burning season. So I rented a Honda PCX 160 and planned to do the tour over 4 days

Inexperienced bikers should do the route clockwise which starts off less challenging and then builds in difficulty as you go
Take the opportunity to visit Thailands highest point at Doi Inthanon (they charge to enter the national park area)
If you want to pootle along and don’t care about enjoying the thrilling ride that the roads can offer, you can get away with renting a 125cc. If (like me) you are a biker, you’ll need a minimum of 155cc underneath you. 
Unless you are massively resilient, 4 days is the minimum you should spend riding the loop.
Getting stuck behind the inconsistent and unobservant Thai drivers in pick-ups and minibuses is massively frustrating. 
The large scale land-burning destroys the entire experience. It’s heartbreaking, anger-inducing and upsetting seeing nature, the landscape and the environment all being destroyed and there is obviously no wildlife to see aside from small groups of semi-domesticated cattle.
Even if you wear a surgical grade mask 24/7 the smoke will still get into your lungs and affect your respiratory system.
The burning really heats up the area with the hot earth from below and the greenhouse effect of the thick smoke.
Fill up with petrol regularly, especially if riding a smaller bike.
Do not miss the Lod caves; Absolutely mind blowing. 
Some of the waterfalls are nice to see, and there’s a brilliant bamboo bridge and temple complex just north of Mae Hong Son city. 
On the way back into Chiang Mai (from the north), you can have a coffee in an Airbus A330 (Air Diamond cafe)

All in all, the Mae Hong Son loops has the potential to be a world-class experience for lovers of 2 wheel machinery, but you have to catch it during the relatively small window when the weather is dry and the locals aren’t unceremoniously scorching the earth. Going back to do it on a ‘proper’ bike (multistrada or similar) is now on my bucket list.",3,keen biker excited experience breathtaking scenery northern thailand negotiating one best challenging road route world research suggested going burning season done face mask spectacular view would somewhat obscured none blog explicitly stated loop burning season rented honda pcx planned tour day inexperienced bikers route clockwise start less challenging build difficulty go take opportunity visit thailand highest point doi inthanon charge enter national park area want pootle along dont care enjoying thrilling ride road offer get away renting cc like biker youll need minimum cc underneath unless massively resilient day minimum spend riding loop getting stuck behind inconsistent unobservant thai driver pickup minibus massively frustrating large scale landburning destroys entire experience heartbreaking angerinducing upsetting seeing nature landscape environment destroyed obviously wildlife see aside small group semidomesticated cattle even wear surgical grade mask smoke still get lung affect respiratory system burning really heat area hot earth greenhouse effect thick smoke fill petrol regularly especially riding smaller bike miss lod cave absolutely mind blowing waterfall nice see there brilliant bamboo bridge temple complex north mae hong son city way back chiang mai north coffee airbus air diamond cafe mae hong son loop potential worldclass experience lover wheel machinery catch relatively small window weather dry local arent unceremoniously scorching earth going back proper bike multistrada similar bucket list

If you're in Chiang Mai, I highly recommend doing the loop; the scenery, the stops, the ride, it's breathtaking! 

I spent one night in Doi Inthanon at KowitFarmStay - 10/10. If nature is your thing and you want something special, head over here! Absolute bliss.

3110,7084759,"This small town originated from the region's Chinese tea plantations and all the hotels and shops are built in a similar Chinese style. The many shops sell more or less identical products and it is noticeable that there are no 7 11s or other grocery/general products shops common to almost all other Thai towns and villages.
The attractive lake apparently (now an important reservoir) began as a small pond and there had been many disputes over the water necessary for agriculture, particularly the tea plantations. To resolve the problem the previous King, Rama 9, created the extensive modern day reservoir, solving the water shortages and also having the side effect of establishing a popular tourist resort with several thousand rooms as well as a clutch of unsightly camping sites.
The surrounding area is extremely beautiful - forested mountains, spectacular roads and a dam as well.

Breathtaking…stunning…incredibly beautiful…unforgettable. A long tailed boat trip on the lake is all of these.
There’s a large car park which costs only a few baht and various cafes and toilets close by.
Before you can sail on the lake, you have to pay an entrance fee for the National Park and bear in mind, as so often is the case in Thailand, a dual pricing policy is used so if you’re not Thai ( it doesn’t matter even if you live in Thailand) you will pay considerably more than a Thai National. 
Once in the National Park, you can arrange a boat trip around the Lake. There are two possibilities: hire a boat for a private tour or join others in a boat which will be cheaper. It’s worth negotiating if you’re hiring a boat for a private tour - we succeeded in bringing the quoted price down considerably. 
The trip itself was absolutely fantastic. Our boatman knew all the best locations for photographing and was really helpful. The scenery is magnificent. You literally will be looking in every direction as the scenery changes continually. Steep
cliffs, rocky outcrops, unspoiled rain forest all come into view as you sail along.
It can obviously become busy and we always try and arrive at the Lake relatively early…it’s cooler and more boatmen are available.

It has many small restaurants, mostly good on the Roadside stops off the Highway. It is a significant engineering achievement, more so because it is where Thailand's first pumped storage Power Station was constructed. 
This review is about another aspect; along a minor road parallel to the Hwy there are numerous vegetable plots and fisherman supplying local catch and produce. If you have time to spend in Pak Chong it is an interesting 1-2 hour alternative to the Kao Yai area. Travel down the Old Mittrahap Rd from Pak Chong, about 5km from Pak Chong there is a slight fork where the main road curves to the right. Go straight on for about 3-4 km, you will find yourself on the Eastern edge of the Dam shore just to the West of the Highway.  There are numerous small Nongs being fished (forming when the Dam level lowers) with small Market Gardens and vegetable plots on the rich exposed strips of land.

3205,4494066,"On August 7, 2019, I arrived in Bangkok Thailand at 5:30 am.   I could only check into my hotel at 2 pm.   I asked the taxi driver to drop me off in downtown Bangkok.   As I was walking I was approached by a friendly person who spoke English well.   He told me he worked for the government and that the government has one day left for providing Tuk Tuk driver’s free gas.   The government would pay Tuk Tuk drivers that worked for the government free gas for tourism purposes.   
The “government worker” called a government subsidized Tuk Tuk driver for me and gave me a copy of the city map with different sites to see.  He explained the driver of the Tuk Tuk would bring me around to different sites and stay with me for $40 Baht.   The driver would bring me to different temples to see and would bring me to get something to eat and go shopping at the “Factory.”
The driver did bring me to different temples; however most of the temples were not open.   I did request for him to take me to get an early lunch which the driver did.   Upon asking to see a temple that was open the driver instead took me to the “Factory” for shopping.   I asked the driver why he took me there and he said because it was now open.   I entered the shop which later I found out the “Factory” has only one shop which I entered.   The Tailor shop had suits and other clothing for sale.   
I met with an English speaking sales person.   He showed me Armani Suits and stated that I could have two suits, three pants, four ties and three shirts for $32500 Baht.   I felt the quality of the fabric and he stated it was a wool and cashmere blend.   I told him that I would be leaving within three days to go to Koi Samui and would need to have the suits made right away.   He stated they make them in the shop and would be ready the next day.   I accepted the offer and paid $32500 Baht.   Realizing after I signed that it was “no refund.”   They took my measurements and setup a fitting the next day.  After the Tuk Tuk driver dropped me off where he picked me up, he didn’t even ask for the $40 Baht which I thought was odd.
The next day I left my hotel for a fitting at the shop.   I met with the tailor who brought in pieces of clothing.  I asked why the suits, pants and shirts were not ready.   He stated it would take four weeks to make.   I told the tailor that is not what we agreed on.   I tried on the pants, a shirt which were the same patterns I chose the day before and did not fit properly.   He took measurements.  He then put on a jacket with no sleeves and pulled up the sleeve to make a measurement.  He then took a picture of me with the pulled up sleeve.   I also noticed they did not feel soft as they did yesterday but rather like polyester.   
I asked the tailor what the materials were for the suits, pants and shirts.   He stated it was cashmere.  The tailor stated the shirt was made of Egyptian cotton.   I told him that was not what we agreed upon.  We agreed upon wool and cashmere blend.  I explained that cashmere was too soft to hold up properly in a suit.   I also explained that the suit and shirt material was not the same as yesterday and felt like polyester.   He explained it was cashmere and cotton.  I then immediately told him that I wanted a refund.   He explained I signed and paid for the clothing with no refunds.   
After I left the shop, I felt like this was a “bait and switch” and a scam.   I looked up the name of the shop, “Dusitta Collection” and found out it was a scam on the Internet.   I immediately called my bank to dispute the transaction and also put a stop payment on the sale.

3206,4494066,"Ok I’m not gonna lie, we were SO WORRIED we got scammed. My husband and I spent a lot of money here to have two winter coats (one for him and one for me), a three piece suit and two button down long sleeved shirts tailor made for us. We didn’t use our credit card because of the discount, we were brought to the store via the standard cheap tuk tuk-meet friendly stranger-wat closed cause Buddha day-etc. trip. We paid all in cash before we got the clothing. In hindsight it was super naive of us, it was literally our first day in Bangkok and we had no idea what we were doing! We just got back to our hotel after ordering the clothing about 12 days ago (we leave tomorrow) and our items were delivered as promised on the day promised, with very nice bags with nice wooden hangers. They added in a pashmina for me and two ties, pocket squares, and cuff links for my husband which they said they would. Every single item fits both of us perfectly. I have absolutely no regrets or complaints! I’m not sure how the tailor gets such bad reviews if everyone gets this quality, but we did not receive anything poorly fitted or made. If this fabric is not cashmere I honestly cannot tell the difference so I don’t really care, it’s super soft and fits me so well. We don’t have anything at home that fits this nicely. We are so happy and 100% satisfied. Maybe the store is hit or miss,or maybe if you go during high season they are over-run with orders and cannot pay adequate attention to each item, I’m not really sure how others have such bad experiences. The mode of getting you there does seem sketchy after you read so many stories, but after seeing this great quality I’m thinking perhaps that’s just how business is done in Eastern cultures and I cannot begrudge anyone for making a commission differently than we do. This was an excellent experience for us.

3219,553572,"To be clear, I think that this should have been a five star experience, and I rated it as such.  But I will admit that doing it the second day that you’re in Bangkok when you’re still jet lagged and don’t know your way around and have limited stamina might not have been the best plan.

We were advised to book a hop on, hop off boat for the day.  It was not a bad plan, and at 140 or 150 BHT per person, it wasn’t that expensive, but I think that one way tickets were 30 BHT per ride, and unless you are very disciplined and fast, you are not likely to be able to tour five different stops in a day.  As it was, we decided that we would go from the beginning of the boat dock to the terminus, then decide which stops we wanted to get off at on the way back.  We spent way too much time wandering the last stop, which really did not have a lot to see, but took a lot of time to figure that out.  So by the time we got around to seeing the Wat Arun and Wat Pho stops (same stop, but you need to take a 10 BHT ferry ride from Wat Arun to get across the river to Wat Pho), it was mid afternoon, and by the time we had seen both stops, we discovered that we had missed the last boat pick up to return.  We ended up walking from Wat Arun to the MRT which was doable, but added an element of uncertainty to a long hot day.  Be aware that the temples will require long pants for men and covered knees and shoulders for women.  There are plenty of stalls to buy emergency rayon clothing for this purpose though, and frankly, you’ll discover that you’d rather live in rayon clothing the rest of the time you’re in Thailand anyway, since it’s much nicer for the heat and humidity, and easier to launder and dry.",5,clear think five star experience rated admit second day youre bangkok youre still jet lagged dont know way around limited stamen might best plan advised book hop hop boat day bad plan bht per person wasnt expensive think one way ticket bht per ride unless disciplined fast likely able tour five different stop day decided would go beginning boat dock terminus decide stop wanted get way back spent way much time wandering last stop really lot see took lot time figure time got around seeing wat arun wat pho stop stop need take bht ferry ride wat arun get across river wat pho mid afternoon time seen stop discovered missed last boat pick return ended walking wat arun mrt doable added element uncertainty long hot day aware temple require long pant men covered knee shoulder woman plenty stall buy emergency rayon clothing purpose though frankly youll discover youd rather live rayon clothing rest time youre thailand anyway since much nicer heat humidity easier launder dry

At the end we got to know the tragic story behind this park and how it got to be unesco world heritage.

3275,454890,"We took a leap of faith and visited Huai Kha Kaeng instead of one of the more famous Thai parks. We were not disappointed. However, we do have some pointers to manage the expectations of future visitors.

What to expect? This is still real wilderness, meaning: only camping facilities in the park, a very limited number of trails and only two view towers. Your wildlife viewing will mostly be done from the car or from one of the towers. Patience is key while you wait for something interesting to come out in the open. Therefore, we do not recommend this park for families with small kids (unless they like sitting still). We do recommend this park for real wildlife enthusiasts because in the three days we were there we saw plenty of wildlife (wild boar, several kinds of deer, gibbons, bats, banteng, civets, more birds than we can count, muntjak, jackals, ...). This park also gives you a very teeny tiny chance to see a tiger (we didn't though).
The wildlife is quite shy, once an animal spots you, it will show you immediately how fast it can run. If you want to take photos, a 300mm lens is a minimum for good shots.

How to get there? The area is quite remote and unless you feel like doing a bus hopping tour, get a guide who provides you with transportation.

Why take a guide and who to take? You will enjoy this park much more if you have someone with you to show you animals. Not many guides operate in this park but we were very happy with Tontan Travels. Doesn't matter what you see or hear, our guide Tony was able to find it and identify it. If we hadn't had him with us, we would have seen only a fraction of the animals we actually saw now. Also ask your guide for an after dark walk to see palm civets, wild boars, tokays, ... .

Where to stay and eat? You can stay outside the park but we thought the bungalows there were of poor value. Camping inside the camp is much more fun and gives you the opportunity to get up early to see animals. The ablution blocks were clean and quite ok when we were there (do not expect a warm shower). Just outside the park there is a little restaurant. We found the food average but it is your only option and you won't go hungry.

What to bring? your camera with telelens for the viewing towers and long pants for jungle walks. Ask your guide for leech socks, in the dry season you won't see leeches but there will be ticks and the socks will make it more difficult for them.

In a nutshell: if you enjoy spotting wildlife and don't mind being patient to see it...go to this park with a good guide and cross your fingers to see a tiger!",4,took leap faith visited huai kha kaeng instead one famous thai park disappointed however pointer manage expectation future visitor expect still real wilderness meaning camping facility park limited number trail two view tower wildlife viewing mostly done car one tower patience key wait something interesting come open therefore recommend park family small kid unless like sitting still recommend park real wildlife enthusiast three day saw plenty wildlife wild boar several kind deer gibbon bat banteng civet bird count muntjak jackal park also give teeny tiny chance see tiger didnt though wildlife quite shy animal spot show immediately fast run want take photo mm lens minimum good shot get area quite remote unless feel like bus hopping tour get guide provides transportation take guide take enjoy park much someone show animal many guide operate park happy tontan travel doesnt matter see hear guide tony able find identify hadnt u would seen fraction animal actually saw also ask guide dark walk see palm civet wild boar tokay stay eat stay outside park thought bungalow poor value camping inside camp much fun give opportunity get early see animal ablution block clean quite ok expect warm shower outside park little restaurant found food average option wont go hungry bring camera telelens viewing tower long pant jungle walk ask guide leech sock dry season wont see leech tick sock make difficult nutshell enjoy spotting wildlife dont mind patient see itgo park good guide cross finger see tiger

The farm stay was average: pretty farm and bungalows but not much to do other than the canoeing or night safari (you can’t do both). Food portions were small and water not included. 
The lake tour was the worst part. We booked the group tour, expecting 6-10 people, but there were over 30 people in one group. We didn’t do anything until 3/4pm because of the amount of people and poor organisation. There was so much waiting around. When we arrived at the lake there weren’t enough bungalows, so they told us to sleep on the floor in the reception area which had no roof or curtains (it was all glass so you have no privacy). The toilets were overflowing with waste and there was no soap. After complaining several times, we were moved to a different bungalow which was much nicer (although wasted even more time), and we enjoyed the swimming and kayaking. We were then promised a trek which turned out to be just a 500m walk, and we couldn’t hear anything the guide was saying because there were so many people. This tour operator also charges far more than others do. We met people on the same tour as us who paid only  2,300 baht for the lake tour.

3346,1315376,"TRIP REPORT – MV EXPLORER FROM SEA DRAGON DIVE CENTER

After my dive buddy and I decided to do another liveaboard trip, I was tasked with doing the research on destinations and trip length.  Given that it was somewhat of a last-minute commitment, there were some limitations in availability in regions that neither of us had previously done.  Thailand eventually topped the list.
Our location on the west coast of Canada meant that a Thailand trip would involve long flights so more bang for the buck would be achieved by a ten-to-fourteen-day liveaboard itinerary.  Although there were about three liveaboards that offered longer itineraries, only Sea Dragon’s MV Explorer had available space on their 13-day trip.  This trip is actually a combination of their 5, 3 and 5 day trips but, in spite of that, there wasn’t a lot of duplication in dives site and those that were such as Richelieu Rock were very deserving of multiple visits.  The one downside of the combined trips was that the final day of each segment only offer 2 dives before heading to a northern fishing village to offload departing guests and await the arrival of new ones.  That did, however, give you the opportunity to off-gas and to take advantage of inexpensive beer.
The Explorer is a 25 Meter (82 feet) wooden hulled ship that has been re-configured as a dive boat.  The Sea Dragon Dive Centre offers this and the steel hulled Andaman as liveaboards and both reflect very good value relative to other liveaboard operators.  They are, however, not as luxurious.  According to staff, the Andaman caters to a younger crowd who don’t mind the mostly dorm style accommodations and 20 divers instead of the 16 max on the Explorer.  The Explorer is slightly more expensive.
The ship’s layout is quite functional as a dive platform.  The dive deck is not really any tighter than other liveaboards I have been on, and crowding is minimized by only allowing one or two groups to gear up at a time.  They divide guests into groups of four plus a guide.  Sadly, all dives are from a RIB dingy since a high-ranking government official had a close call with a big boat upon surfacing a few years ago.  He issued an edict that there would be no jumping off the big boats any longer.  The boat staff are great in assisting divers on and off of the dingy.  Each dive station has a milk crate for gear.  There are several freshwater rinse hoses as well as a camera and computer rinse tank.  The camera table is quite small and, since it is also used by the cooks, your set-up will be gently moved out of the way when they need it.
The booking price does include a full set of dive gear.  From a glance, the dive gear appeared to be relatively current, name brand items that are well maintained by the staff.  Do be aware that the BCD’s are not weight integrated.  The bonus for guests using the boat’s gear is that, at the end of their trips, they leave it to the crew to clean, dry and put away.  If you bring your own gear (as we and a few divers did) you get a 10% discount off the price of the trip…but make sure you tell that to the diver centre staff when you are making the final payment.  They do provide, at no charge, weight belts or weights for integrated BCD’s, dive computers (Zoop), torches for night dives and not particularly good SMB’s.  Tanks are standard 12 Litre/Aluminum 80’s with DIN or Yoke available.  Larger 15 Litre tanks are available.  Guests gear up and head to the dingy when called and the boat crew will have already grabbed your fins to be put on when you are seated.
Everyone is different in terms of their need for thermal protection and that will vary depending on the time of year.  For me and for this trip in May, a 2-mil shorty was fine but be prepared for massive temperatures due to upswelling currents.  There were times when we felt like we had gone from a hot tub to an ice bath and the computer recorded temperatures as high as 87 down to 73 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The dive deck also has three washrooms with toilet, sink and shower for a quick change between dives.  The dive guide cabin is located on this deck as is the kitchen.  Past the kitchen are 6 ensuite guest cabins that accommodate two guests either in twin or double configurations.  They are very well air conditioned but, contrary to website claims, doesn’t really have ample storage space.  That is a very good reason to pack far less clothing as this is, after all, a dive boat and not a fashion show.  There are 220 Volt round pin power outlets for each bunk, good individual reading lights and a decent pillow and blanket.  The pads on the bunks did make me appreciate the hotel mattress and the Thai massage after the trip.  It is not an overly spacious cabin but not outrageously small either.  All of these cabins have a good size sea view window that could be used for an evacuation should the principal exit be blocked.  The combo toilet, sink and shower washroom is small but adequate.  The provided towel is not overly plush, and you may wish to bring your own for topside or the beach.  When booking you should be aware that these are the only cabins with ensuite washrooms.  The two double cabins on the middle deck do not have ensuites and do need to utilize the washrooms on the dive deck….one deck down.  
The middle deck is the key area between dives.  It has a considerable amount of seating for meals and socializing along with coolers/freezers for drinks and ice cream treats.  Certain items such as beer, wine, coffee capsules and ice cream cost extra and are on an honor system for guests to record consumption.  Prices are more than reasonable.  All meals, buffet style, are served here and you will not go hungry.  The middle deck has some charging availability and a very large supply of clips for drying clothing on the rails along each side of the front deck right to the bow.  The two double cabins are on this deck.  This deck is where all the pre-dive briefings take place and the daily dive schedule (subject to change due to weather/current) is posted.  Each guest has an insulated drink container (with identifying letters) to borrow although many bring their own.
I will say that my dive buddy and I, in addition to liking the great boat staff and dive guides, had a great connection to John Carter…. our trip supervisor and our dive guide for the two five-day segments.
The upper deck would be considered a sundeck and has full length pads, hammocks and bean bag chairs and is partially covered as well as open for sunseekers.  It does get hot up top.
THE GOOD
•	Very good value…not the Hilton but above a Motel 6
•	Exceptionally delicious and plentiful food…both Thai and Western with consideration to vegetarians upon request.  You would be hard pressed to find better on any boat.  The routine was usually: briefing, dive, eat and surface interval.  Repeat three and four times daily.
•	An incredibly hard working and delightful boat crew and dive guides.  I have only done about 10 liveaboards and have had equal but never better crews and guides.  We especially enjoyed John and Nat who were our guides.
•	We also had the pleasure of having two dive master’s in training who accompanied us on all dives and did guide some of them.
•	Small dive groups and a strategy to be woken up early so as to have a quick briefing and to get in the water earlier than the other big boats.  Once we have done that, then the food and surface intervals for us and the other boats generally kept us well apart.
•	Extra charges for Nitrox were reasonable as were the treat and beverages that required payment.
•	Dive groups organized based on experience.
•	A nice assortment of guests from various ends of the earth.
•	Dive guides who cater to guest requests when it comes to finding marine life.
•	Dive boat supervisors who offered exceptional communication throughout the trips.
•	Some world class dive sites…especially Richelieu Rock that was full of massive schools of fish and lots of pelagic predators.
•	Sea Dragon Dive Center itself as they were reliable in advance communications and took care of things like arranging reasonably priced taxis to and from the dive center or recommending hotels. 
•	The recommended tip level is more than reasonable and more than deserved.
•	A skilled and experienced Captain.

THE NOT SO GOOD
•	Somewhat smallish sleeping quarters.
•	Cabin mattresses that were not overly kind to your back.
•	Smallish camera table compared to other boats
•	No Nitrox analyzers available to guests.  Instead, a staff member would sample one tank and declare the percentage for everyone diving Nitrox.  The boat should invest in a couple of analyzers for the guests to do their own testing to sign off.  This is how nitrox divers were taught during their course.
•	The SMBs for the guests are pretty basic and do not include a reel.  You may wish to bring your own.
•	Although they provide torches for night dives and the guide carries one back-up, any further fails would end the dive.  Bring your own as a back-up.
•	Not exceptional visibility.  Probably 50 feet tops.  That may have been a product of the time of year.
•	The limit of two dives on the transition days.
•	Not seeing mantas or whale sharks.  Certainly not the fault of the boat or the crew and likely the time of the year.  We did make up for it by finding a large Bull Shark on one dive.

the send on the beach is quite good, fine etc., but the water can get very polluted - depending on winds and tides - not recommended for swimming. There are the usual banana-boats and the occasional jetski. 
The southernmost end of the beach it not blighted by deckchair and umbrellas and the Northern end has pavilions and restaurants. They also stage music concerts and night markets there.This is a long beach - several kilometres so walking from one end to the other is only for the most determined of walkers.
the traffic on beach road can get very congested and occasionally the roads are blocked off - Speed week sees the town converted to a race track and bike week sees about 20,000 bikes of all sizes descend on the town - centred around one noisy week-end.

We are relatively fit and have hiked before and it took us 2 hours each way- the path, once you find the starting point, is relatively easy to follow, crossing the river many times! 

(I am unaware if there are other routes) We started from Wonderland camping site- this for some reason does not come up on google maps app but does come up when you search google maps online and hired a moped to get there from Pai town. From here we crossed the stream, went across a field and through banana plantation and across the stream again to then follow the river most of the way, crossing it many times until you reach the marked sign. 
(When you get to the sign that says 1 hour steep bypass to the waterfall do not let it put you off, it took us about 30 mins from this point.)

The jungle is beautiful and the waterfall at the end is just as lovely- it was not deep enough to swim but a quick dip to cool off and admire the surroundings was rewarding after the hike. 
I would recommend to wear lightweight trainers that you don’t mind getting wet or suitable walking shoes that you can cross the stream in- personally I would not opt for flip flops!

The trail is very easy to follow and idyllic the entire way to the falls (although it requires a lot of jumping over rocks across the stream as you go!).

Personally, I love to go to the beach. I need to visit at least one beach every year. And this place was really amazing. Food and drinks are not that expensive and also delicious as well. Most important things is the sunset view is absolutely gorgeous! Golden sky, crystal ocean, and snowy sand.

Usually you have to pay big bucks for this stuff but it is virtually free here, and much closer to Bangkok than any other snorkelling/clear water beach destination.

Popular activity in this zone is to buy eggs and boil them in these hot springs (with a suitable time indicated on the signboard at each pool) making ""onsen tamago"". 

The other zone is Chae Son waterfall. Accessible by hiking, this beautiful waterfall has 6 levels. There is a pond with many fish at some levels, so don't forget to buy food to feed them.

3467,555157,"This is Lampang's hidden gem. It's one of the most beautiful places in Lampang. It's a ways out of the city, but if you rent a motorbike or take the train, it's one of the MOST AMAZING rides of your life. The views along the rode are like nothing you'll ever seen. The Northern Thailand landscapes are unparalleled.

I've heard some people complain about the price - it's really not bad cmon! Yes, locals have a lower price - but that reflects the salary ratio of what local Thais make. 

20 baht for locals (75 cents in US) vs. 200 baht for foreigners (around 6 USD). Like seriously?? Are you really going to complain about 6 dollars? the average monthly salary for an avg worker in Lampang is around 15,000 baht (500 dollars) so yeah, they are going to have a cheaper price. I know this because I lived in Lampang. Don't complain! 

THE thing to do in Chae Son is to boil eggs in the hot springs. It's an ""only in Thailand"" experience. Something about the temperature or the minerals makes the eggs boil from the inside out. So if you boil for 15 minutes, you will get an egg that has a soft-boiled yolk and a gelatinous (but cooked) egg white. It slides right out of the shell. Eat with soy sauce. Best egg you'll ever taste. 

There are also many hikes to waterfalls and such in Chae Son. There are free places to swim in the hot springs too and you will often see local kids splashing around.

3470,4322381,"This temple is located outside the city of Nan. It is +- 750m far from Nan River and the main bridge that will take you to the city. The first structure is the Wat, it is wide open, with some particularities like 2 emeralds made with stained glass laid on a pedestal in both sides of the Wat. The Wat has a beautiful altar with 3 big sculptures of the Lord Buddha seated, from which the biggest is at the centre. The wall behind is beautiful painted with an amazingly black colour and sparkling golden lotus flowers. I didn't have the idea of this Wat being built for a particular sign of the zodiac (in this case, the rabbit as someone has written though). The golden Chedi is located in a separate area, and it is surrounded by stalls where anyone can buy Buddha images, candals, ""phuang ma lai"" to pay respect to Buddha. The Chedi is very tall and large and outside there is a small temple house with a huge golden Buddha inside. The area of this complex is very large so there are some stalls selling foods and beverages at the entrance road. In a central point there is a huge tree (where I relaxed for a while...) that is surrounded by sculptures of Buddha in different positions and other Buddhism beings. The surrounding grounds were owned by the last Lord of Nan province, so you can expect to find beautiful gardens, big trees and a very well organised area. Next to the wat area there is an entrance to the building where monks are studying.
We can easily exit this complex using the 45% inclined road and have an awesome view of the city and great sunset views...
This road ends at the roundabout and going straightforward will take you to the bridge and the city of Nan.

3477,1762543,"This rural northern Thai style temple is most famous for its founding monk being credited with saving many younger monks and novices by fore warning them that he had a premonition that that the sleeping building was going to collapse that night during a windy rain storm and he insisted they they leave the building and it for what seemed no reason it did blow over that night thus saving many lives.

Aside from that history it is a very pretty wooden temple which is also the villages community center so you will see on any given day a slice of rural northern Thai culture going on at the temple also being located in a farming community where still to this day many of the fields are still planted and cultivated by hand offering a great photo opportunity so see the hand harvesting of rice fields by local families. 

This is just a bonus to the beautiful teak wood temple with its ornately carved  doors, windows and well tons of accents and historical items. As well be sure to check out the grand hall Buddhist temple murals. You will surely see the mummified remains of the former head monk who has yet to be cremated. His body is covered in gold leaf and on proudly on display, which to many westerners may be a bit strange but is a sign of great respect in Thai culture.

Located in Samut Songkhram province, this market is unique because it's set directly on active railway tracks. Vendors line the tracks, selling everything from fresh produce to souvenirs, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The real excitement begins when a train approaches. We had the unique perspective of witnessing this from inside the train, boarding at Ban Kalong. As we neared the market, vendors quickly retracted their awnings and moved their goods just inches away from the tracks. The market transformed into a narrow pathway, with the train passing slowly and closely through it. After the train passed, everything returned to normal within minutes, showcasing a seamless blend of daily market life with this extraordinary event.

Beyond the thrill of the train, the market is a sensory feast. We explored the stalls, sampling fresh fruits, seafood, and delicious street food. The friendly vendors added to the charm, making our experience both thrilling and flavorful.

I would say that if your time is limited, you could give the smaller section to the southeast a pass. The temples there are very nice, but similar enough to what you will see in the larger section. I spent about three hours total and saw everything I wanted to see except for a few out of the way temples in the far west of the larger park, which were guarded by enough stray dogs to make me nervous about getting out of the car. Each temple has a signboard explaining the history, construction, and key features of that complex. The larger temples have one or more QR codes which link you to YouTube audio descriptions as well. Very helpful and very interesting. The entire park is located within a shaded forest, making it comfortable to visit even on a hot day.

3505,12697318,"This fortress was built in 1794 during the reign of King Nangklao, to protect the city of Chachoengsao from invasions.

Later, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn, the army used it as its base for suppressing the Ang Yi Rebellion, which consisted of illegal Chinese opium dealers who plundered many areas of the city. 

In front of the fort wall is a public park where you can get a scenic view of the Bang Pakong River.

Constructed of bricks and cement, the fort wall stretches from the east to the west with a width of about one metre, a length of about 200 metres and a height of three metres. 

I have read that five cannons of different sizes can also be found along the wall, but unfortunately during a recent trip to Chachoengsao I was unable to see either the fortress wall or the cannon because a high green fiberglass fence has been erected along its entire length, and only the tips of top of the wall are visible.

At the gates, I paid 230 baht-the 200 fee for a foreigner, and 30 for my car, and I headed for the HQ & visitors’ centre.
After I had “spoken” to several rangers-no one had any English; I was told to head up to Chong Yen if I wanted to see hornbills. So, I took the winding and often times narrow, road up-and all the while, the weather worsened, turning into a heavy drizzle at the top, with poor visibility.
I nevertheless took the very wet track leading a small way into the jungle, and stumbled on 2 birders in their hide. They were intent on a small flock of white-necked laughingthrush, so I took the opportunity of getting a few pics myself. However, given the poor light, and my being some distance from the birds, there were no photos of note. Needless to say, I did not see any hornbills this time round, so shall have to return at a dryer time. 
What there were plenty of were dragonflies and butterflies by the river.

3530,8611263,"Amazing, one of a kind wood carving museum, mostly created by very old large teak wood (one piece with no join, no glue, carved to enchanted water/fire/termite damages of old wood - which makes the works really unique), most pieces were carved by the Lanna wood carving legends, some pieces took over 10 years to complete. This is a house museum with 5 levels and the collections of over 1000 pieces. The pictures here are just on the ground floor where photography allows, what upstairs are mind blowing. In fact, the museum is frequently visited by the Thai royal family, some of the pieces have been purchased by them and now display in the palace. 

I had a previllage to have a long conversation with Kun Charoui, the owner. Maintaining a wood carving museum is extremely hard work, spiders, ants and many insects love to nest in the empty spaces inside the carving, some are very difficult to clean, so dusting abd cleaning is a full time job here.

Kun Charoui employs all his workers from disadvantage backgrounds. Unfortunately, as a result, the guild doesn't speak English and does not have enough experience and expertise to sufficiently curate the museum in my opinion. 

If you want English tour, please contact the museum before you go, hopefully you will get Kun Charoui  to show you around. Meeting him will leave a lasting impression on you. He is one of a kind, just like his collection.

This place is a real labour of love,  triumph against adversity. You money goes towards preserving the disappearing art of Lanna wood carving and funding the museum's Buddhist park at the back, which is free for anyone to visit.

The market is named after the little, bright yellow, sweet bananas grown in Kamphaeng Phet called egg bananas (kluai khai) but there is much more on offer than bananas and banana plants - wooden furniture, baskets and other woven products, brooms (big and small), pork crackling, fruit and vegetable chips, sauces, preserves... the list goes on. The market is popular with people traveling between Bangkok and points north, especially on weekends.

Nevertheless, if you are in town, you might want to stop by Wat Trai Phum and see this locally famous statue. There is a somewhat intriguing local legend that goes along with it at least.

The Phra Buddha Maha Thammaraja statue dates back to the Khmer era and it is probably of Khmer not Thai origin. Its early history is cloaked in mystery but it ended up at Wat Trai Phum, a minor wat which was founded in 1557. (None of the buildings at the site today seem to be more than about 100 years old, however). The statue made a real nuisance of itself by wandering out of the wat one night and bathing itself in the cool waters of the Pa Sak River, which is located just across the road from the temple. The locals brought it back to the temple but they now have an annual festivity in which the gilded idol is immersed once more in the waters of the Pa Sok River every year. 

The venerated image is perhaps more likely to appeal to Thais than foreigners. (Yet there was no Thais viewing it during our visit either). For us, we enjoyed learning a bit of local legend, but a single statue and some unimpressive modern buildings make for a very minor ""sight"".",2,havent heard famous phra buddha maha thammaraja statue dont worry hadnt either probably case worldfamous phetchabun nevertheless town might want stop wat trai phum see locally famous statue somewhat intriguing local legend go along least phra buddha maha thammaraja statue date back khmer era probably khmer thai origin early history cloaked mystery ended wat trai phum minor wat founded none building site today seem year old however statue made real nuisance wandering wat one night bathing cool water pa sak river located across road temple local brought back temple annual festivity gilded idol immersed water pa sok river every year venerated image perhaps likely appeal thai foreigner yet thai viewing visit either u enjoyed learning bit local legend single statue unimpressive modern building make minor sight

The road was being repaved in a very unorthodox, unorganized Thai style that made travel more difficult and a little dangerous. As we neared the top, past the popular template, the road got more narrow and took on the look of a woods road only still asphalt. The view was incredible from this height and a little unnerving with a primitive attempt to keep your vehicle from plunging off a cliff in the form of a semi guard rail. We saw no other vehicles as we approached the summit. As we reached the top we came across a large clearing jammed with primitive housing structures on the perimeter of tourist shacks selling souvenirs. There is a concrete path that winds its way up the mountain as it passes through stall after stall of souvenirs. Most of the stall workers don’t speak to you. Some say hello. Many young women played with their phones, not even looking up. About half way up there is a museum of tribal artifacts to view for 10 baht. The museum is actually a small enclosure the size of a one car garage. Exit through the back and you’re outside in front of a beautiful, massive, hillside garden of flowers and herbs. The concrete path continues through the garden up and up until you are very high above the village with a great view of the garden below. A little higher up and you enter a cafe with cold and hot drinks and coffee beans for purchase. There are also bathrooms if needed.

With so little tourist infrastructure nearby it would appear mostly reliant on people arriving by way of their own transport - Not an option for all. Day tripping from Sukhothai (if that is even an option as didn't see much sign of it) risks having ones time at this place rushed.  Best done by foot or bike, yiur barely scratching the surface if only using the tram. The steep hill /steps are well worth traversing to see the sites up top.  

 The point is this place deserves a visit, deserves to be done properly and as such deserves far, far more from the local and national Tourism Authorities (Inc paths cleared to each of the ruins, the descriptions of each of which are often uninteresting  offering no story about the community which built it) 

The place would lose charm if flooded by tourists but still more could be done that could aid preservation efforts, share more of Thailands history and bring greater benefit to the local population.

3632,13505937,"Wintour are the only bus company to operate between Sukhothai and Chiangmai.  One cannot book direct with the company online but through a third party.  This made me uncomfortable as I could not be sure that the tickets would be honoured and there was no way to contact Wintour for conformation.  Also there is no indication of where the Wintour bus will stop in Old Sukhothai for the onward journey to Chiang Mai.  The bus stop is at the end of the old town opposite a tiny wat  and the Abandon Koff Cafe.  It is on the side of the road that is going to New Sukhothai.  Passengers are led across the road by a staff member holding a red flag to stop traffic!  You must exchange your paper ticket from the third party for a confirmed ticket from the Old Sukhothai office (preferably done at least the day before).  You will be asked to find your name on the seats indicated on the computer screen.  If it is not there, the lady will ring the office at the New Sukhothai bus station and your seat will then be confirmed and you will be given new tickets.  There are some seats and a toilet (western style but no toilet paper) at the office.

The buses to Chiang Mai leave at 9.50am (9.30 from New Sukhothai) and 10.50 from Old Sukhothai.  Prior to ascending the steep stairs to the upper level you are given a drink, cake and bottle of water.  If you have booked early enough (bookings open 30 days before departure) you may be lucky to get the front seats which have ample leg room but your view through the dirty windows may be partly obscured by an old non functioning tv screen.  The buses are certainly not new or VIP.  The seats are reasonably comfortable.  Our bus did stop a number of times to let passengers on or off at unscheduled places and although it did stop at a bus station, we have no idea of which one as there was no sign and the bus did not stop for more than a couple of minutes (driver toilet stop).  We did not use the on board toilet down stairs as going up and down the steep stairs would have been hazardous on a moving vehicle.

The seating is two x two.  The bus stops at Terminal two in Chiang Mai and you will need to go to Terminal Three (across the road) if you are purchasing Green bus tickets or any other tickets.   The bus is met by crowds of tuck tuk drivers and hotel touts.  Get a Grab or Bolt if you are not comfortable negotiating a fair price for your travel to your accommodation.

At BLES, visitors spend their days out in the forest watching the elephants graze and interact with each other.  I always enjoy the delicious, vegan food served there. Lodging was provided at a quiet, comfortable homestay less than 10 minutes away. Despite the language barrier, staff is so welcoming and kind. I am truly grateful for the hours I spent in conversation with founder, Katherine, who not only runs the sanctuary but takes the time to make every visit special for visitors.

Pancake! 
What a special time I had and I will always cherish my time at BLES. 
The welcome guests receive is so warm and friendly. 
But the reason I went to BLES, was to see elephants. I have been a supporter of BLES for years but hadn’t been able to visit until this year. Finally, I made my booking and was able to get to Thailand after three attempts. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!  
BLES is a 100% true ETHICAL Elephant Sanctuary. 
No riding, no bathing, no feeding, no chains and NO bullhooks.  All the elephants have been rescued from very sad places and now live in the best place at BLES. They have many acres set in the forest where they browse on their natural, lush, green foliage.  They bathe in mud holes and running waterways. Every day is a new adventure as they choose where they want to roam. The elephants have their own groups of friends they stick close with. They play and vocalize together, and are a family herd… just like they were born to be in the wild. They heal both physically and emotionally here at BLES. 

As a visitor… a guest of BLES… only 6-10 people are permitted at a time to keep the human aspect at a minimum. The elephants come first so keeping their world “theirs” is priority. You will fall in love with the absolute tranquility of observing them as they spend their day doing what elephants do!  Every day brings new adventures and the wonders of these gentle giants!  
A Picnic in the forest is the perfect lunch served to you while you sit and watch these magnificent elephants. Not to mention, the food is delicious!  You may even get a personal special visitor if you are lucky!  
Your accommodations are only 10 minutes away in a cute air conditioned hotel up the road from the sanctuary. 

You’ll help cut up some fruit and make sticky rice balls for Nwon. You’ll watch Katherine tend to the “Gossip Girls” feet where she maintains them to help them stay healthy. All on elephant time… they are never forced, only encouraged with special treats. 

The COFFEE on my last day that the mahouts made was FABULOUS!  The picnics, the food!  And especially all of the stories. 
I believe BLES is the most perfect place for these special elephants to have as their home. A place that is the closest they can be to being wild. BLES must continue to be able to provide more elephants this beautiful life. 
Your support is greatly appreciated and helps tremendously with the ongoing care of all the elephants and the rescue of new elephants in desperate need of sanctuary. 
Make your reservation now… you will be glad you did because there is nothing like this in Thailand but BLES

Being around the elephants, the dogs, the nature and all the amazing sounds in nature, works healing for heart and soul. On my first day back the lovely gossip girls welcomed me with their joyfull trompetting. It touched my heart and I felt like I was returning home. I just love going on the elephant walks. Stop where the elephants want to stop, see them disappear into the forest and climb on the hills. Something so many elephants are not allowed to do and some of them will never get the chance to have a life like this. The mahouts take such a good care of the elephants. It amazes me every time to see how they put their trust in their mahout, in the strong bond they have created troughout the years. The housekeepers make the most delicious food. One of the highligths of the day was going out with the truck and the staff to go collect banana trees for the elephants. The scenery is so beautiful. And everyone is so kind. I loved going this time of year because everything is very green. Don't let the raining season hold you back from going! I recommend BLES to everyone who wants to have an experience of a lifetime.

Not an issue for me, because it comes from the hot spring stream, leaves and dirt does fall down into the pool.
There's a new pool system with filtered water and swim pool like tiled pools environment in another location nearby, but it doesn't look open yet, and the rates would be different here based on the signage posted there. I like the current natural looking pools better.

It's truly astonishing to contemplate how ancient people managed to construct such a massive city. The entire district spans approximately 866 hectares, which leaves us even more impressed.

3743,4322620,"Si Thep Historical Park was the last of the 11 historical parks in Thailand that we have visited. Despite this park not getting many visitors and not highly touted by tourism officials, we found it to be very interesting and well maintained (as with all of the parks managed by the Department of Fine Arts. The entire Si Thep Historical Park has been placed on Thailand’s list of “tentative” UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The ancient city of Si Thep consists of two connected sections, with surrounding moats and walls. The distances in the park are quite far, so it's advisable to avail of the free shuttle service provided by the park to reach the park highlights.  Entrance fee for foreign visitors is 100 baht.

The site was notably surveyed by Prince Damrong Raanubhab in 1904, who had found historical references to the town, which had been abandoned and reclaimed by vegetation. There are not many ruins remaining, but those which do exist are quite interesting. Prang Song Phi Nong and Prang Si Thep date to the 11th and 12th centuries. 

Most interesting for me were laterite and brick monuments that date back to the 8th century.  The base of Khao Klang Nai has some amazing stucco motifs, and although many have been looted over the years, several are still exquisitely intact. The large Khao Klang Nok Monument is located about 2 kilometers north of the main ancient city of Si Thep.  It's comprised of a massive laterite base, measuring 64 meters square and 20 meters high. On top of the laterite base are the remains of what was once a huge brick stupa (now collapsed into a pile of brick rubble).

Also administered by the Si Thep Historical Park is Tamorat Cave, which reportedly contains some fabulous ancient stone carvings. Unfortunately, the cave site is not set up for tourists (something that is not mentioned in the English-language brochure for the park) and can only be visited with special approval that must be request at least 7 days in advance.

While hardly comparable to Angkor or Borobudur it is of interest to those who enjoy architecture and ancient history. It reminds me a lot of the Hindu ruins in the Dieng Plateau in Indonesia.

We had the opportunity of getting some first hand knowledge, assistance from a charming member of staff - Miss Sunar who was a delight to meet.
 
 What has me guessing is the origin of a female skeleton that is 1.8 m long and that was dated 1-2 thousand years ago when the average height would have been lucky to be 1.4 metres.

3751,456512,"Phimai was an important town when the Khmer Empire ruled over much of Thailand, so it’s no wonder the temples here bear some resemblance to Angkor Wat and some think Phimai to be a prototype for the famous monument. In fact, when you finally walk into the inner courtyard, it does feel like you’re looking at Angkor Wat, and I’ve been there!

Phimai is a triple walled buddhist sanctuary that was regularly maintained and repaired, for which we have to be thankful. The outer courts are largely in ruin and there is not much to see. The bridge linking the outer and inner courts are in very good condition. The first set of steps of the bridge is guarded by lions, while the second tier is the more traditional Buddhist Naga bridge. The bridge links the human and heavenly realms of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology,

The entrance to the main temple is decorated with images of dancing Shiva. The entrance leads into a long narrow passage with architraves decorated with reliefs of scenes from Ramayana.Further in, the reliefs turn to Buddhist scenes. The main altar has an image of Buddha being sheltered by Naga. The mandapa above the Buddha has a high ceiling. It’s mainly on the exterior where there’s a lot of decoration, most prominently several giant reliefs of Garuda.

3752,456512,"Phimai Historical Park is a historical park in Thailand, covering the ancient town of Phimai and the ruins of Prasat Phimai, the largest ancient Khmer-Hindu temple in Thailand. It is located in the town of Phimai, Nakhon Ratchasima province. It is one of the most important tourist attractions in the province.

Most buildings are from the late 11th to the late 12th century, built in the Baphuon, Bayon and Khmer temple style. However, even though the Khmer at that time were Hindu, the temple was built as a Buddhist temple, since the inhabitants of the Khorat area had been Buddhists as far back as the 7th century. 

Didn't know a whole lot about this place before I arrived so was pleasantly surprised when I had the chance to see some real history in Korat. Entrance was a very reasonable 1 Euros 23 cents, a bargain, considering I spent well over two hours here, wandering around the ruins and taking in all the breathtaking temples, monuments, and ruins. 

There were not so many tourists as well, a few, but as the place is big enough everyone is well spaced out, which is great for taking some photos and for taking your time walking around.
There is plenty of areas for one to sit down and take a break, under a tree in out of the sun, or for a close up at the stone work involved in the building of the ruins.

The gardens and lawns, and the ruins themselves, are very well maintained and looked after, and there are toilets and bathrooms available, and a mini museum for people to learn more about the Khmer history of the area. 

For people who perhaps cant visit Angkor Wat, for whatever reason, this is a good Thai alternative (not that I have visited Angkor Wat - but it feels like it is!) 
Loved it here, and I'd strongly recommend this as a place to come and see, especially if one is interested in history and local culture.",5,phimai historical park historical park thailand covering ancient town phimai ruin prasat phimai largest ancient khmerhindu temple thailand located town phimai nakhon ratchasima province one important tourist attraction province building late th late th century built baphuon bayon khmer temple style however even though khmer time hindu temple built buddhist temple since inhabitant khorat area buddhist far back th century didnt know whole lot place arrived pleasantly surprised chance see real history korat entrance reasonable euro cent bargain considering spent well two hour wandering around ruin taking breathtaking temple monument ruin many tourist well place big enough everyone well spaced great taking photo taking time walking around plenty area one sit take break tree sun close stone work involved building ruin garden lawn ruin well maintained looked toilet bathroom available mini museum people learn khmer history area people perhaps cant visit angkor wat whatever reason good thai alternative visited angkor wat feel like loved id strongly recommend place come see especially one interested history local culture

Then next I stopped in my tracks as I had to squeeze through a very tight space and also keep low, my thoughts were I could not do it and I would have to backtrack. I was driven on my a number of Thai people behind me willing me on, I thought I was actually stuck for a moment as I had to inch forward slowly just squeezing through. What a relief.
The worst was ahead when I had to get down flat on the ground and crawl through a low gap opening which this time I was sure to be stuck, how I managed I don't know. Now it was plain sailing just a little stroll and a wooden ladder a rope to pull up on and another metal ladder and out.

3782,550655,"We did visit and spend some time at this beach on a number of occasions during our recent stay in Ao Nang in January. 

We walked to the beach which was a distance of about three and a half kilometres from our Hotel, BlueSotel Smart. 

This beach is definitely less commercialised and quieter than its neighbour, Ao Nang Beach. There was a distinct lack of tourists here during the day. 

It stretches along the coast for about three kilometres and comprises of a mixture of white sand and small seashells which creates patches in the sand that looks pink. 

It has three small island at one end Ko Liao, Ko Khao Sam Nuai, no name for the third one. At the other end the Do Do River (Haeng) flows into the sea.
The water's of the Andaman Sea are very shallow here, walk into the a good distance and still only knee deep. 

At low tide the long-tailed boats, at the far end of the beach, get stranded on the sand until the tide comes back. 

There are no facilities on the beach, no sunbeds or umbrellas, the only shade provided is by the trees that are along the back of the beach. 

We did spend a good number of hours on our beach towels in the shade provided by the trees.

Along the main street at the back of the beach is the Ao Nang Landmark Night Market. There are also a number of shops and food outlets were supplies can be bought for visiting the beach. 

Sadly a lot of litter, food cartons and drink related, gets dropped during the evening then makes it's way on to the beach. It would appear that the beach wall is used as seating and a table and the cartons dropped. As this beach is less commercialised beach cleaners are very infrequent visitors, also the tide does come in rather close to shore and washes it away. 

As the tide does come in rather close there is a coastal defence system comprising of stones and rocks fasten by wire which is along the beach wall. Not really attractive but necessary.

3806,554899,"Just back from a family trip to this national park with three kids (8, 9 and 11 years old). As a birding and wildlife enthusiast this was a GREAT EXPERIENCE. Also for the kids. Many animals seen, especially the beautiful dusky langurs and white-handed gibbons. Also we were lucky and saw one sunbear and one gaur and a couple of malayan purcupines. And a plethora of birds and butterflies.

Stayed two nights camping at Ban Krang Campsite where we rented tents and gear. LOVELY and HELPFUL STAFF and hearty food at the small restaurant (closes late afternoon so stock up on instant noodles or get a rice dish ""to-go"" and keep it for dinner). When we went to bed in the evening there would be thousands of fireflies in the dark giving everything a magic touch, and in the morning we woke up listening to the song of the gibbons. What's not to like? One afternoon we saw a very peaceful little sunbear on the fringes of the campsite behind the kitchen, and at night porcupines could be seen when we spotlighted with a strong torch. Campsite itself also quite good for birding. We hired a GREAT GUIDE at the campsite one day and he was very knowledgeable and good at spotting birds and wildlife. Camping in nature is of course always a bit basic and uncomfy, but it is a fantastic way to experience the wilderness if you are a bit adventurous and prepared to go roughing it a little bit.

Also stayed two nights outside the park at the Baan Maka Nature Lodge which was also very good - to our family this gave the perfect mix so we could explore the park over several days without rouging it too much (and we saw a leopard cat ((Prionailurus bengalensis) when walking the nature trail at the lodge premises after dinner one evening).

We booked a car/driver and a birdwatching guide for two days for our tours into the park through TONTAN TRAVEL. That worked EXCELLENT. Very knowledgeable and hard-working guide striving to find interesting birds, reptiles and mammals for us. They took us all the way up to Phanoen Thung Campsite one day and the other day we primarily spent at the lower sections between the two campsites and between the park entry gate and the first camp-site. Tontan travel also helped is book transfers from Bangkok and futher south after our stay in the park and that also worked very smoothly.

This national park is great. Not many tourists when we were there and a good wilderness vibe. Most of it is dense jungle, so very difficult to spot mammals apart from the daytime-active squirrels and langurs/gibbons, and only very limited possibilities to do spotlighting after dark (only on campsite grounds hence have to sleep overnight at the campsites inside the park at least for part of the stay if spotlighting is of interest). Only one road leads into the park so you end up walking/driving quite a bit back and forth this route when optimizing chances for spotting birds and other wildlife. 

If you are a little bit serious about seeing birds and wildlife and experiencing a fascinating ecosystem I would highly recommend this park.",5,back family trip national park three kid year old birding wildlife enthusiast great experience also kid many animal seen especially beautiful dusky langur whitehanded gibbon also lucky saw one sunbear one gaur couple malayan purcupines plethora bird butterfly stayed two night camping ban krang campsite rented tent gear lovely helpful staff hearty food small restaurant close late afternoon stock instant noodle get rice dish togo keep dinner went bed evening would thousand firefly dark giving everything magic touch morning woke listening song gibbon whats like one afternoon saw peaceful little sunbear fringe campsite behind kitchen night porcupine could seen spotlighted strong torch campsite also quite good birding hired great guide campsite one day knowledgeable good spotting bird wildlife camping nature course always bit basic uncomfy fantastic way experience wilderness bit adventurous prepared go roughing little bit also stayed two night outside park baan maka nature lodge also good family gave perfect mix could explore park several day without rouging much saw leopard cat prionailurus bengalensis walking nature trail lodge premise dinner one evening booked cardriver birdwatching guide two day tour park tontan travel worked excellent knowledgeable hardworking guide striving find interesting bird reptile mammal u took u way phanoen thung campsite one day day primarily spent lower section two campsite park entry gate first campsite tontan travel also helped book transfer bangkok futher south stay park also worked smoothly national park great many tourist good wilderness vibe dense jungle difficult spot mammal apart daytimeactive squirrel langursgibbons limited possibility spotlighting dark campsite ground hence sleep overnight campsite inside park least part stay spotlighting interest one road lead park end walkingdriving quite bit back forth route optimizing chance spotting bird wildlife little bit serious seeing bird wildlife experiencing fascinating ecosystem would highly recommend park

Our guide Mong spoke good English, was extremely knowledgeable about the wildlife and was tireless in looking out for animals to show us. All in all, very professional.  Mong also carried extra binoculars and a scope which was really handy for us amateurs and even reminded us about topping up on insect repellent! It was apparently a lean day for sightings (and I think I read that wet season generally is not great) but we were thrilled to watch families of gibbons and dusky leaf monkeys in the treetops, clouds of butterflies also spotted a mouse deer, water monitors and all manner of weird insects and birds including hornbills and eagles (I am not the birder in the family!). Mong also spotted recent panther prints.
The view from the second campsite at the top of the hills is stunning but be warned, the drive up is extremely bumpy.
A long, tiring day but for all the best reasons. Already planning our next trip.

3837,3668484,"This was a unique and fun experience unlike any other I’ve had in Thailand. The hike is a grind but was fairly easy (I’m an experienced backcountry hiker). It took my wife and I 4 hours to get to the campsite (I think I could have done it in 3 hours if hiking solo). The first 7km involved a 1200m ascent and the last 3km was flat. 

We rented a tent (3 person sized), sleeping pads, sleeping bags, pillows and a blanket. We hiked up on a Thursday so the campsite was fairly slow. We were the only people in our section which was nice. It got considerably busier on Friday. 

Make no mistake; this is glamping. There are restaurants, coffee shops, gift shops, flushing toilets and showers at the campsite. You can even charge your phone at many of the restaurants (there is full cell service). 

The second day we rented bikes and explored the plateau. The waterfalls were all closed off due to wild elephants. We were fortunate to see a wild elephant, a true highlight of the trip. 

The hike down took 3 hours. We hiked down on a Saturday so there was a steady stream of people hiking up. If I do this again I would time it to avoid Friday-Sunday. 

Overall this experience offers a great workout, beautiful views, wildlife and many comforts.",5,unique fun experience unlike ive thailand hike grind fairly easy im experienced backcountry hiker took wife hour get campsite think could done hour hiking solo first km involved ascent last km flat rented tent person sized sleeping pad sleeping bag pillow blanket hiked thursday campsite fairly slow people section nice got considerably busier friday make mistake glamping restaurant coffee shop gift shop flushing toilet shower campsite even charge phone many restaurant full cell service second day rented bike explored plateau waterfall closed due wild elephant fortunate see wild elephant true highlight trip hike took hour hiked saturday steady stream people hiking would time avoid fridaysunday overall experience offer great workout beautiful view wildlife many comfort

3840,3668484,"I've heard of this place for multiple years but only finally had the chance to visit the national park. Due to covid, the number is capped at 1,000 people, instead of the usual 5,000 per day. 

Reservations for the tent can either be made online or on the spot, and you will not need to carry any of the camping gear up as they are all up at the summit. And you can hire porters to carry the rest of your gear up for 30 baht/kilo. 

The trek up can be challenging, the key is to make sure you have proper footwear as the terrain can be muddy and steep especially at the start and end. I am an average 27 year old and it too me slightly more than 3 hours to summit. Others would take much longer, but there are multiple stalls that sell food and drinks along the way. 

Once you hit the top you will have to walk another 3 km to reach the main campsite, equiped with toilets and restaurants. 

The optimal amount is 2 nights - first is to hang around around the shorter attractions and the second is to visit the further ones such as Pha Lomsak and the waterfalls. 

If you want to save time, the best option is to rent a bike, although the path to the cliffs can be a bit rugged and some mountain biking skills are required. 

Strongly recommend this place.",5,ive heard place multiple year finally chance visit national park due covid number capped people instead usual per day reservation tent either made online spot need carry camping gear summit hire porter carry rest gear bahtkilo trek challenging key make sure proper footwear terrain muddy steep especially start end average year old slightly hour summit others would take much longer multiple stall sell food drink along way hit top walk another km reach main campsite equiped toilet restaurant optimal amount night first hang around around shorter attraction second visit one pha lomsak waterfall want save time best option rent bike although path cliff bit rugged mountain biking skill required strongly recommend place

Activities: There are plenty of activities waiting there for you to explore. In the daytime, you could go to bath at the natural hot spring, boil the eggs with the natural water for your lunch, go to the waterfall uphill and survey the way of people’s life there. In the afternoon, you go uphill to “Kiw Lom” landmark to watch sunset and pitch your tent. At night, you cook easy dinner and sleep in your tent under the sea of glittering stars. FYI, all the electricity will be cut after 9 pm but the place still shine will the starlight! At 4 am in the next morning, you have to wake up and go hiking for 4.5 km in order to catch the first ray of sunrise!
Food: Simple, easy, local, yet delicious. The local people there will cook for you. There is also shabu set provided in case you want to cook on your own. 
Travelling: A bit difficult. You have to rent a truck to bring you uphill. It costs 1800 THB and available for around 10 seats.

3875,3547844,"Although I have visited Chaam several times, I had no idea this forest park was here. What a great place to spend the morning. Easy motorbike ride from town. The park at the base of the mountain is pretty and is worth a stroll around on the paved pathway. If you're up to a short climb, you can take the stairs to the left and hike to a beautiful view point. Continue around the pathway, and you find the path leading up the mountain. This is a bit tougher of a hike, with steep climbs and some sharp rocks to navigate. There are two main view points high up on the mountain. Between the first and second view points is where you find the toughest footing, with the sharpest rocks. The second view point offers a stunning view of the rice fields, and farther off to the sea. Continue around the loop and you end up back at the starting point. 

Most of the trail is shaded, but it's still pretty hot up there. I drank over 2 liters of water. 

Many people mention the sharp rocks and the need for hiking shoes, but I walked the trail wearing hiking socks (see photo). I also could have hiked in flip flops, although I am an experienced flip flop hiker with strong feet. 

Here's a tip - although the natural way up the mountain from the paved pathway is to follow the first trail you come to, if you continue around the paved pathway you will come to what would normally be the exit point off the mountain. If you use this path to ascend, you will reach the second view point in just 350 meters, and there are no sharp rocks to walk across. It's a pretty steep climb though!

There is a coffee stand near the parking area, but it was not open when I visited.

I came on a Sunday morning. I recommend coming early. When I arrived there were just three motorbikes and no cars in the parking area. When I returned there were dozens of motorbikes and cars, plus a tour bus.

The daughter, (who grew up in the house) saw the importance of saving the house when she became a well known university professor and saw her whole neighborhood vanishing. She was able to donate the estate to the city for a museum. During the process she was able to move her father’s teakwood clinic to the backyard of the small museum grounds. It was also a joy to see the architecture and furnishings. There is another small building that has a old traditional kitchen on display.

I went there with my family and it was a unique experience for me - never having been inside a Buddhist Temple before. Again respect for Buddha is essential when visiting these holy sites and taking your shoes 👞 off before entering is part of that respect. The floors are all tiled, smooth and very clean so there is nothing to worry about even going bare footed. 
The  gold balls are very interesting made from mock gold leaf and it is customary to add a few leaves to each ball as well as lightly strike the big gong too. Like so many Thais- I myself prayed for good luck, good health, healing and prosperity for our loved ones and friends. 
This is not as elaborate or ornate a Temple as those 50 miles away in Ubon as it is basically a wooden structure- but that doesn't matter as it certainly has a holy aura about it. At night they light it up and it is quite spectacular to see. You can easily see Laos from here across the trees and river beyond.

To get there we caught a Grab to the Zoo, which was only around 80baht from the Holiday Inn Chiangmai (15 min journey), and walked. We went out of the entrance to the zoo, turned left, and then there is a small cut through down a small but paved road which has a sign, though it's quite faded.
I believe we were there during a drier time so the waterfall was easily accessible with a lot of bare rock and only a relatively small stream of water down the centre. Per the title, it was not busy at all with maybe 10 other people there. We also walked upstream and climbed part of the waterfall for some photos!

4034,3653858,"First the positive, this is a beautiful site.  The falls are lovely but only 2 of the falls were more than a few meters in height, the rest are smaller tiers along a babbling brook. The area is well maintained with plenty of parking, clean toilets, and spaces to change clothing.
Now for the negatives.  We came to this spot because locals had said it wasn't as crowded as Erewan Falls. This is true, but on a busy day, it could be very full as well with only a few families. When we were there, we were the only people in the water.  People said these are the most beautiful falls in Thailand. This is such a subjective statement and we have visited others that are more impressive and just as beautiful.  
On arrival, admission is 300Baht per person plus 30Baht per car. Most signage is in Thai. We walked down about 10 minutes to access for swimming at the 3rd falls. On arrival we  were told we had to pay to go in the water and the staff didn't want our friends, who were not swimming, to walk further. It was not pleasant as we were actually yelled at by the Thai attendant (the only time in 5 weeks a Thai raised their voice to us). We walked back up to the car, got our 20Baht each and walked back down, about 15 minutes. Then she insisted we leave 100Baht each for a deposit for the mandatory life jackets. We only brought money for swimming, had the tickets, and just said no  we had to pass this spot on the way out so would drop them off. She was mad. There was signage at the booth clearly stating that swimming was 20 Baht but there was no indicator for deposits or receipts. We had only brought down 20 Baht each from the car. She followed our friends for quite a while shouting 'No swim, no swim'. They were walking the trail. We intended to swim and were willing to pay but this should have been stated before we left the parking lot so we didn't have to climb up and down. On our way out, the booth was closed and she was nowhere to be seen. We left the life jackets with park workers. This really colored our experience here as foreigners.  The site was lovely but not extraordinarily.  Given our experience here, I would recommend, if you are deciding between the two, to choose Erewan Falls.

The animals (sheep and goats) are fun to feed and pat. We enjoyed riding around the farm on bicycles and swimming in the lake. The meals are farm-to-table and organic, it felt so healthy and filling. The drinks are so creative and my favourites are the signature classic Thai tea ice drink and butterfly pea, passionate fruit and wild honey drink. My favourite dishes are their pad Thai, turmeric fish + brown rice, grilled seabass with pumkin puree and to finish the brownie and chocolate ice cream.

Once you arrive at Suan Lamai you will find a big open parking space to fit a lot of visitors. During our visit the fruit season was over and we knew it. So no surprise there. We did not come for the fruits anyway, but wanted to stay at the caravan park for a night. After a lot of research within our area we found this place and it raved with great reviews on FB. The check in was easy and nothing special. First disappointment was, that we are only allowed to check-in after 3pm, even though it stated 2. Anyhow, we found a nice Pizza Place outside the estate. Once we have been able to get to our caravan the biggest issues started. The caravans are old. Ours was at least 7 years and not well maintained. The beds are not worth to speak about. They charged our 2 little kids an extra THB 1000 per night for a small bunk bed, which did not even fit right. The queen bed was so thin, that you could feel all slats of the slatted frame. The windows could not be opened and partly already broken. The blinds were broken of some of the windows so that you could not open. Other windows had been wrapped from the outside so not visibility there as well.
The bathroom smelled like pee, which only became obvious when we closed the door and windows. Actually not a miracle as the bathroom consisted mostly out of plywood repaired areas. The silicone in the shower was already moldy. and part of the floor of the bathroom and caravan was actually only holding because or the lamination and glue.

4112,12787623,"What an experience battle conquer was! Being a Mum of 2 small children I wouldnt usually have the time to travel to Thailand however as they were on holiday with their Dad I thought why not! And I'm so glad I did.

I spent 7 days there and it was no where near enough. 

Accomdation:
There are 2 camps and the accomdation differs.  I paid for a basic room and was in the yoga camp.  If I went back I would stay at the muay Thai boxing camp as the rooms are more modern and next to the pool.  However, although basic, they have everything you need and are cleaned every day.  You don't spent alot of time in your room. 

Trucks run from one camp to the other at certain times however outwith there are bikes to use.  I walked a few times and it isn't long just make sure you avoid the rain! 

Timetable: 
Packages vary however I had the full fitness and wellness package.  The only issue I had was trying to fit everything in !! There's loads of choice; muay thai is on twice per day and there are a number of different yoga options with something different every day.  The muay thai rainers are amazing, they make you work hard however have a laugh with you whilst doing it! The yoga teachers all have different styles but each one of them are so kind, friendly and knowledgeable and go above and beyond to support you.  This was amazing given I was totally new to yoga! There are trips also.  I didn't attend alot of them given my short stay. 

Food: 
The food was great.  Everything is prepared fresh each day.  You can request a raw breakfast/ dinner.  I had a raw breakfast every morning with a few eggs and it was so fresh and tasty. Breakfast and dinner is served however for lunch you help yourself to tuna, cheese, bread etc from the fridges  theses are located at both camps. 

It's hard to sum this place up in a review.

4113,12787623,"I had no idea what to expect when I signed up for two months at Battle Conquer, but it ended up being exactly what I needed! 

I’m 51 and spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical. My goal is to learn new things, so learning Muay Thai seemed like a fun option. I signed up for the wellness package after seeing some other classes I might enjoy. 

When I arrived, I was so nervous! Would I fit in? Would I be terrible at it? Would I be the only person who hadn’t done Muay Thai before? Would I be the oldest person? What I found was an incredibly welcoming and diverse group of fantastically fun and non-judgmental people of all different skill levels and abilities from all over the world. Classes were fun and it really did feel like being at summer camp as a kid. 

I also learned that I’m not really into Muay Thai, but that I absolutely love yoga! Laura, Grace, Anjelie, Chris, and a couple of other wonderful teachers each had their own teaching styles that made classes fun and challenging. (Special shout out to Laura and Grace, whose kindness and encouragement still mean so much.) I spent my days in yoga classes, at the pool, and laughing, laughing, and more laughing with so many beautiful people who were on their own journeys. 

Sixty days went by so fast, and like so many other people who come, I hope to return one day, maybe even as a yoga instructor.

4145,4322842,"Nam Nao National Park is on the major highway between Northeast Thailand and North Thailand.  This makes the highway busy.  The busy season for the park is during winter because it gets colder there that most of Thailand.  That is why the thermometer is famous - to show how cold it is!  Since we went in August it was warmer, but definitely cooler than the Bangkok area.  We drove about 5 hours from Ayutthaya Province.  The park was not very busy at all.  Some days we were the only tourists around!  The weekend, which was the Queen's birthday and thus a holiday, was a bit busier - but still there were very few around except the workers.  We stayed 6 nights.
We stayed in bungalow 301.  It is the only 6 bed cabin.  It worked well for our group - 2 grandparents, 2 parents, and 5 children.  The one room had 4 beds, wall to wall, so no one would roll out of bed unless they were sideways.  The parents and children all slept there.  The children were ages 8 months to 10 years.  They did have a small playpen for the baby to use, but she sometimes slept with everyone else.  This room had a cupboard with 6 towels in it. It also had 4 hooks to hang things on. The other room had 2 beds side by side, and worked well for the grandparents.  This room was also the main room.  There was a decent size refrigerator with separate door for the freezer, which was nice.  We hadn't expected a refrigerator so had brought a cooler and ice, expecting to use boxed milk (which the Thai use regularly) after the first day or two.  We refroze the ice and used it when we returned.  There was a TV (which we didn't use), a hot pot, and some bowls, cups and silverware, and a dish drainer.  There was a cabinet that was locked that we used for a counter.  This room had one power strip that was the only power outlet. There was a little bit of empty space in this room, which was needed for walking back and forth.  The front door was at the foot of the beds.  The bathroom was off of this room as well.  This was a typical Thai bathroom with shower, sink & toilet (Western style) all together with no partitions.  There was a hot water heater, but the higher you turned the heat up the slower the water flowed.  There was a mirror over the sink with a ledge for toothbrushes & toothpaste.   There was also a back door to a little porch where there was a sink for washing dishes. There were screens on the windows, but there were cracks around the doors.  Also the bathroom drain was unscreened so large spiders and moths flew in there.  One night I got bit numerous times so turned on the light and found my bed was full of tiny ants that were biting me.  They were coming in under the door at the foot of the bed and found a shirt that had a bit of fruit juice on it.  These ""sugar ants"" bite!!  There was a can of bug killer in the cabin and a quick spray on the bottom of the door stopped the ants.  There was a small covered porch where there was a table and 4 chairs.  There was a little yard with a concrete picnic table and 4 concrete stools, but there were lots of ants by the table and all over the yard.  We still played a lot in the yard.  One night we went outside and watched the beautiful Perseids Meteor Shower, something we could not have seen from the city.
 I will try to scan the map of where the bungalows are so you can get some idea of where certain numbers are.  There is not a map on the National Park webpage. The cabins seem to spread out from the Visitor's Center.  There are usually 2 cabins somewhat close together.  Cabin 301 was the closest, which made it easy to go get ice cream cones or bars from the little ""gift shop"".  There was one little restaurant open that we ate at every day, either for lunch or supper/dinner.  The prices were a little higher than other places, but still not bad.  A meal for all 9 of us that would usually coast about 600 baht ($18 US) cost about 800-900 baht ($25-$27).  That includes drinks.
WARNING: The trails that start by the Visitor's Center have leeches on them.  On the sign it says snails, but these are land leeches.  We started taking one trail the first morning, assuming that this would be like the leech trails at Kao Yai National Park, where we got 2 leeches on 6 of us the whole walk.  These trails are very leechy!!  We turned around shortly as the 4 year old started to shriek and we all had leeches on us - on our socks, under our feet on the insoles of our sandals, on our legs, etc.  These leeches look like dark inch worms - they crawl like inch worms and are small and thin.  They keep one end on the ground and wave the other end around looking for a victim!  They bite right through your socks, crawl up your legs, and hang on leaving your leg bloody when pulled off!  We later bought special canvas leech socks at the ""gift shop"" for 80 baht a pair (about $2.50) for the ones who decided to brave the leech hike.  In the one kilometer hike the 6 year old counted about 120 leeches.  These are just the ones she saw - not all those that were hiding in the leaves.  The man at the Visitor's Center told us the leech socks were 30 baht a pair.  I don't know if their price went up that much or if that is the price during the busy season and it was higher because it was off season.  
There are other trails that do not have leeches on them.  The hike to the Sai Thong waterfall and Heo Sai waterfall had no leeches.  However the pamphlet given to us at the entry gate was not accurate.  We decided to go to the farther one first, then return to the other.  In the pamphlet it says that Sai Thong waterfall is only 500 meters beyond Hao Sai.  When we arrived at the ""Y"" one sign said Sai Thong 2375 meters and Hao Sai 120 meters.  We went to the left and walked a while and came to a stream that went over Hao Sai waterfall.  It was pretty, and refreshing.  We walked on and on until the 8 year started screaming!  She had hit a wasp nest and was covered in wasps.  Grandpa took his shirt off and knocked the wasps off of her.  The 8 year old got 9 stings, the 10 year old got one, and Grandpa and Daddy each got one rescuing the others.  Needless to say we turned around there and went to Hao Sai waterfall.  We soaked the stings at the stream, then continued to the other waterfall.  The children played around by the waterfall and Grandpa went swimming.  We went back another day and all splashed in the water, stood under the waterfall, and swam for several hours.  The water was the perfect temperature to play in for hours!!  This was the favorite day for many of us.  We took a picnic lunch and ate it as far away from where we were playing as possible as the ants were awful.  Daddy dropped the rest of us off and then went to the nearest town to get gas and some groceries.  He still had time to play in the water after he got back!!  
One evening we went to ""Sunset Viewpoint"" or ""Tham Pha Hong"" viewpoint.  We went early so we could look for a small cave that seemed to be near.  There was a parking area by the main road where we parked.  There was a road that we walked up, but it had huge puddles and was very muddy - suitable only for 4 wheel drive vehicles or motorcycles.  We came to the end of the road and found the path, stairs, going up to the viewpoint, but no sign for the cave.  We split up, going 3 different directions and found the cave by going past the parking area or viewing area there on a small winding path along the side of the hill.  There was a steep ladder going up to the cave so Daddy helped all the children with Grandpa receiving at the top but Grandma stayed down as she had hurt her wrist.  While she was waiting Grandma heard a loud racket, and thought it was from crows or squirrels.  Well she finally saw two monkeys!!  Phayre's Leaf-monkey is what they have there, and they were swinging in the tree tops.  We all went up the 259 steps to the viewpoint and took pictures but came down before the sun set because it would have been hard to come down all those steps in the dark.  We spread a mat on the parking area and ate our picnic and watched the sun set.  It was beautiful!
Most of the hikes required us to leave the National park boundaries, but we just showed our pass each time and only had to pay the first time.  Sometimes we didn't even need to show anything as they recognized us.  
There were lots of signs warning of elephants, but we never saw any elephants.  There were many lovely butterflies, moths and birds that we saw.  We saw dung of different animals, smelled animals nearby, and saw ""foot"" prints of many animals, but did not see any large animals at all.  We did see a large - about 6 inches long - black scorpion on the driveway one time, but it never got near us.
Hint - we took a clothesline along and found a way to hang it up under the eaves of the porch.  It came in very handy - for bath towels, for swim suits, and so we could wash juicy clothes right away to keep the ants at bay.  Take soap along for washing clothes as well as dishes.",4,nam nao national park major highway northeast thailand north thailand make highway busy busy season park winter get colder thailand

Nam Rin is, to my mind, the pick of them.

It is about 500 meters long, with golden sand, and at the eastern end, large boulder-type rocks, on the largest of which sit a pod of granite dugong statues, which are probably the most photographed dugongs in Thailand as those in the wild are an increasingly rare species.

Also at this end of the beach is a garden, but it is unkempt and littered and I do not consider it at all a pleasant place to sit or linger.

The back of the beach is lined with stately Casuarina Pines, and these form shady picnic spots popular with Thais.

There are a couple of restaurants along the service road, but otherwise no real development, which makes this a peaceful retreat.",3,nam rin beach one three beach ban chang district rayong province others payun beach phala beach nam rin mind pick meter long golden sand eastern end large bouldertype rock largest sit pod granite dugong statue probably photographed dugong thailand wild increasingly rare specie also end beach garden unkempt littered consider pleasant place sit linger back beach lined stately casuarina pine form shady picnic spot popular thai couple restaurant along service road otherwise real development make peaceful retreat

The park is not run very well and I feel the attractions are misleading. Many rides were not operational and the park is run down.

The lazy river is not like other places in the world. It is just a pool and does not have a feature to move water which would make it a lazy river.

The wave pool could be amazing but they no longer make waves. It is simply a large wading and swimming pool. Others were disappointed and surprised as well.

Given that it takes time to get there I would not recommend this place as it will consume a day of your holiday and you will most likely feel cheated.

4270,4309253,The Siam Tulip is known as the Krajiew Flower. The park is basically a foot path along the slope of a mountain where the flowers seasonally bloom. There is a festival associated with the blooming and the tour buses arrive in mass. The park is large so you really don't get a sense of how many people are there except at the entrance. For those who like to trek the festival is accessible without a tour bus or car. At the foot of the mountain leading to the park is a bus stop. There are usually a couple of young men with motorcycles waiting at the stop (motorcycle taxi) to ferry people to the top. The trick is to hire the driver for a couple of hours to wait while you are in the park so they can take you back down. There is no regular transportation provided by the park back to the bus stop. Advanced trekkers can figure out a way down but novice find themselves panicked a little. The Thais are very gracious when approached politely and 400 THB will solve most of your problems when trekking.,4,siam tulip known krajiew flower park basically foot path along slope mountain flower seasonally bloom festival associated blooming tour bus arrive mass park large really dont get sense many people except entrance like trek festival accessible without tour bus car foot mountain leading park bus stop usually couple young men motorcycle waiting stop motorcycle taxi ferry people top trick hire driver couple hour wait park take back regular transportation provided park back bus stop advanced trekker figure way novice find panicked little thai gracious approached politely thb solve problem trekking

4323,317729,"During our time in Thailand, visiting a traditional floating market was one of the most unforgettable experiences. These markets, known for their vibrant atmosphere and unique boat-based shopping, offered a deep connection to Thai culture. We explored the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, where narrow canals lined with stalls and wooden houses bustled with activity. As we glided along the canals in a long-tail boat, we encountered vendors selling tropical fruits, handmade crafts, and souvenirs, all from their boats.

The floating market was more than just a place to shop; it was a lively community where vendors, many of whom had been there for generations, greeted us with warm smiles and offered samples of their goods. The highlight was the incredible variety of food, including refreshing coconut ice cream and a delicious lunch at an open-air restaurant. We also enjoyed bargaining for unique souvenirs.

Visiting a floating market in Thailand is more than a shopping trip—it's a journey into the heart of Thai culture.

4422,7333233,"Last year, I visited Khlong Bang Luang with my friends. It was an easy trip and filled with good memories for all of us. It was quite convenient to travel, so we hopped on the MRT to Bang Phai station. However, since the Artist House is located in the middle of the village, we walked around 10 minutes more to get there. This part can be confusing for a first-time visitor. If you don’t feel like walking, the other way is by motorcycle taxi at the entrance to the side street. And if I remember correctly, it would cost around 15 baht. (I recommend this way better if you are a newcomer.) 

When we arrived, it was a little bit smaller than we expected. There were several shops open for tourists, but not all of them were on weekdays. We were there early that morning. So we had no problem with overcrowding, unlike on weekends. There are several activities for us to do. For example, feeding the fish, painting on a canvas, learning how to make gel candles, and various handcrafts. If you are interested in artistry, you can buy many beautiful souvenirs from this place. We decided to spend our morning and afternoon painting some pictures and beading bracelets at the artist house while admiring the view of the canal with the long-tail boats passing by. 

Overall, the experience at this place was pleasant nonetheless.

The market itself is for the locals and you may not see another European whilst in-side.
The meat and fish area are not for the faint hearted and watching a trader skin live frogs/toads was an experience to see. My daughter was keen to move on and see the vegetable selection after the live chickens were also being killed to order.

plus the “aroma’ of the raw food with the likes of fresh seafood.
Whether you are there in the day or night, be prepared to have rodents roam around freely in your tracks.
If you are keen on getting fresh fruits at pretty affordable prices and you are within the Sukhumvit area,
Khlong Toei is worth a visit.
Across the street is the open air food areas serving local Thai fares.
As the food are mostly cooked fresh, I would say that they are generally safe to eat if you are concerned.
If you are concerned about cleanliness, do not like funny/stinky smell, and cannot take the heat…the Khlong Toei

4457,1069819,"Dahra Spa is an absolute gem - if you are looking to relax in the heart of Bangkok, it doesn't get any better than this.

Last week I was in Bangkok to visit a good friend who had recently started living in the city as a digital nomad. I was keen to find somewhere that could provide a great massage both to untie some knots left over from the flight and to just relax and enjoy my holiday in general.

After some quick Trip Advisor and Google review research, Dahra Spa looked the part - close location (Silom Branch), extensive menu and great reviews. I booked myself in for an hour treatment, a Royal Thai massage.

On visiting, I was very impressed with the facilities and the service - the receptionist was very organised and welcoming, the waiting area was very comfortable and the overall vibe of the place was incredibly relaxing - no mean feet after you step off the busy streets of Bangkok in Silom.

I was asked if I had areas I wanted to focus on, areas I wanted to avoid, medical conditions, pressure levels etc - it was a very thorough and professional experience.

The massage itself was excellent - the first part was very relaxing and targeted to the areas I wanted to focus on, so lots of tension in my upper back, shoulders, neck etc (typical desk worker). Pressure was great and the therapist regularly checked in to see how everything was feeling.

The second part was very much the Thai Massage experience, with a lot of manipulation into different positions, stretching and massage. It can seem a bit intimidating at first, but the reason it works so well at Dahra is they clearly know exactly what they were doing - where I was stretched, moved and massages, everything was done within my limits and without causing any pain or discomfort.

I walked away feeling lighter and more comfortable than I had felt in a long time - an absolutely wonderful experience. I cannot recommend Dahra Spa enough.

Payment: Almost all of the shops accept ONLY cash. Very few were accepting payments via digital modes such as QR code. I was not able to spot shops accepting credit/debit cards. So make sure you carry an ample amount of cash (Thai Baht)

Parking: Ample car/bike parking is available along the outskirts of the market. I am not sure whether there was any dedicated parking lot. But everyone was parking along the side and this was free.

Entertainment: Live music stage has been setup right in the center of the market with numerous tables where you can grab a seat to enjoy the food and music.

Things to keep in mind: 
-No washroom facility so you need to smart enough to enter the nearby established outlets/supermarkets and (maybe) make a purchase before you are allowed to use the washroom. 
-Sets up only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday that too in the evening/night.

... however, whay most probably do not know that behind the huge Buddha statue atop the stairs is a path that leads on and on. There are structures that get higher and bigger. The skywalk is also there as is Buddha's footprint and finally a large gold shrine. Buddhas footprint interior is still being completed with its gilded motifs and decorative paneling.

4634,8820425,"Having experienced the vibrant and lively atmosphere of Khao San Road during the Songkran Festival, I can confidently say it's an experience like no other. The entire street transforms into a water-filled playground, where locals and tourists alike come together to celebrate the Thai New Year with water fights, traditional ceremonies, and endless festivities.

The energy on Khao San Road during Songkran is infectious, with music blasting from every corner, colorful water guns spraying in all directions, and people dancing and laughing in the streets. It's a true celebration of unity and joy, where cultural traditions blend seamlessly with modern revelry.

One of the most memorable aspects of the festival is the sense of camaraderie among participants. Strangers become friends as they engage in friendly water battles, sharing laughs and good vibes throughout the day. It's a time when everyone, regardless of background or nationality, comes together to embrace the spirit of Songkran. 

Of course, no review of the Songkran Festival on Khao San Road would be complete without mentioning the delicious street food stalls lining the street. From traditional Thai dishes to international favorites, there's something to satisfy every craving as you take a break from the water festivities.

4660,2087136,"I did extensive research on cooking schools before I selected Khao.  Other more famous ones cater mainly for tourists and they all have very similar menus to choose from.  Khao can offer mainstream cooking class but more importantly, they have great selection of dishes for serious amateur chef like me, who does not work in a restaurant.  For those who are more adventurous and curious about Thai cuisine, this is THE place to be.  From the assistants to the instructors, everyone there is super passionate about food and thai cuisine.  Our instructors, JC and Toey, both had been chefs at a great thai restaurant.  They love what they do and you can feel that through out the classes that they want us to love thai food and they teach us to cook like a thai!

We learnt to make common dishes such as Phad Thai, Satay, and curries.  But we made pretty much everything from scratch.  We made the curry paste with a mortar.  We tasted the curry paste as we made it, so we know what flavor we are aiming for.  We had the recipes but what JC always tried hard to teach us was what the ""flavor"" should be like because that is a better way to learn the dishes.  

We also learn to make some dishes that are not common in America.  We made many salads and seafood dishes that are commonly found in Asia and in more authentic thai restaurants.  Through cooking different dishes, we learnt about Thai cooking and Thai's way of  life.  It was just wonderful.

JC is a great instructor.  She will always take the time to answer our questions.  She taught us the components and complexities of thai food.  She introduced us to all the thai ingredients and how to achieve the balance of the sweetness, saltiness and spiciness in Thai food.  Everyone at Khao takes cooking to a whole new level: Even the garnishes and plating are professionally done.  You can see from the photos.  I spend 4 days with them and I was in Thai food heaven!",5,extensive research cooking school selected khao famous one cater mainly tourist similar menu choose khao offer mainstream cooking class importantly great selection dish serious amateur chef like work restaurant adventurous curious thai cuisine place assistant instructor everyone super passionate food thai cuisine instructor jc toey chef great thai restaurant love feel class want u love thai food teach u cook like thai learnt make common dish phad thai satay curry made pretty much everything scratch made curry paste mortar tasted curry paste made know flavor aiming recipe jc always tried hard teach u flavor like better way learn dish also learn make dish common america made many salad seafood dish commonly found asia authentic thai restaurant cooking different dish learnt thai cooking thai way life wonderful jc great instructor always take time answer question taught u component complexity thai food introduced u thai ingredient achieve balance sweetness saltiness spiciness thai food everyone khao take cooking whole new level even garnish plating professionally done see photo spend day thai food heaven

This class was great.  The cooking school is located of KhaoSan Road, fairly easy to find.  The teacher JC was great.  The class only had 8 people and the recipes I wanted to learn were covered.  The class started with some information about Thai cooking and then a demonstration  and tasting of the things we were going to learn to make.  Then we each went to our woks and were assisted in making 4 dishes - Tom Yum soup, Stir fried chicken with cashew nut, fried rice and green curry.  We also learnt how to make the paste for green and red curry.  

I would highly recommend this cooking school.  Lots of great advise was given about substitutions for vegetables etc that you may not be able to get in your home country.

4663,2087136,"First a little background, I work in the foodservice industry. I was planning a recent trip to Bangkok and I decided to ask a friend that is a corporate chef for a major chain for reccomendations for a chef school in Bangkok. He reccomended Khao San. In looking at their website you will probably recognize several culinary figures here in the US and around the world that have attended the school. The school was founded by Kobkaew Najpinit and her daughter, Ning. Kobkaew is considered the godmother of Royal Thai cuisine. Kobkaew and Ning have been invited several times to lecture and present at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone here in the US. They have consulted on several Thai cookbooks by some of the best known chefs of Thai cuisine. I was very excited to get the opportunity to learn Thai cooking at Khao San. 
The way the school is set up is you select 3 dishes that you would like to prepare. The ingredients necessary are assembled. Ning not only explains the ingredients and preparation techniques but also makes sure that she illustrates the history and cultural importance of the dish. Food is extremely important to the Thai culture. While Ning and her brother do an excellent job in the techniques of wok frying or grinding curry pastes, they particularly excel in explaining Thai culinary culture. Ning actually holds a masters degree in anthropology in addition to being a very good chef. The school is set up in the back of the D&D Inn on Khao San (or sarn) road. This area of Bangkok is kind of a funky, bohemian area of backpackers and hippies and worth a visit even if not attending the school. However, the school is very professionally equiped, light. airy and very clean. I know there are several more ""tourist"" oriented schools mass marketed in Bangkok, however if you want the same culinary training in Thai cusine that many of the most well known chefs around the world have gotten then I would reccomend the Khao San Cooking school.",5,first little background work foodservice industry planning recent trip bangkok decided ask friend corporate chef major chain reccomendations chef school bangkok reccomended khao san looking website probably recognize several culinary figure u around world attended school school founded kobkaew najpinit daughter ning kobkaew considered godmother royal thai cuisine kobkaew ning invited several time lecture present culinary institute america greystone u consulted several thai cookbook best known chef thai cuisine excited get opportunity learn thai cooking khao san way school set select dish would like prepare ingredient necessary assembled ning explains ingredient preparation technique also make sure illustrates history cultural importance dish food extremely important thai culture ning brother excellent job technique wok frying grinding curry paste particularly excel explaining thai culinary culture ning actually hold master degree anthropology addition good chef school set back dd inn khao san sarn road area bangkok kind funky bohemian area backpacker hippy worth visit even attending school however school professionally equiped light airy clean know several tourist oriented school mass marketed bangkok however want culinary training thai cusine many well known chef around world gotten would reccomend khao san cooking school

They also make a pier stop at Ratchawong for Chinatown and Rajinee for Wat Pho and Museum Siam.

After visiting The Grand Palace, we got back onto the boat and went to ICON Siam for lunch before catching the boat again to head back to Sathorn pier where it was an easy walk to BTS Saphan Taksin. On another day, we purchased another One Day River Pass and visited Wat Arun and back to ICON Siam.

They say this tour can take you to Asiatique Riverfront, but the only time it takes you is from 4pm, and based on their brochure there is no return trip from Asiatique, and it is hard to get the information from the staff if you don’t speak Thai.

4697,21180243,Phra Pok Klao Bridge has a combined  bike lane / walking trail that goes over the Chao Praya River. Free from motor vehicle traffic its quite a clever idea. I chose to go there for a walk being bike less at the time.  The bike lane is interspaced with plants and benches where you can sit and watch the river traffic go by.  Its also accessible by wheelchair. There being a lift at either end. I was there in the middle of the day and the river views were fab. There's a ferry terminal (N6 Pier Memorial Bridge) nearby so its quite easy to access. Just a short boat ride  from Saphan Taksin Pier.  Underneath  the bridge is Phra Pok Klao Park through which you can access the skywalk. I meant to go back during the evening because its a lot cooler and the views were said to be better. Everything being lit up at night. (It was a bit hot during the day even with an umbrella)  There are public toilets in the park below the bridge. They were fairly basic. At the time I visited there was a layer of black mud (not all dry) throughout the building. I gathered it was from the recent floods and hadnt been cleared yet.

The main building is very well organized and informative. A lot of collections are displayed with an English explanation. This building also has 3 rooms that display the gold artefacts. And it is beautiful. Definitely worth visiting and seeing.

4706,7715997,"This museum can only be visited as part of a guided tour group. Tours leave the reception desk every half hour on the hour and half hour. It is not necessary to book ahead, just wait for the next tour. The museum has some video presentations and exhibits covering the history of trade and of money. It is informative and not restricted to coins alone as the name might suggest.

The museum includes items from a pre-existing coin exhibition, now closed, that was previously located in the Grand Palace.

The only criticism I have is that the tour lasts only 1-1/2 hrs and is rushed. There is so much to see that an increase in length to 2 hours would seem appropriate. For example, there is one area with a set of coins of each denomination for a large number of the world’s countries, maybe all, didn’t catch how many. Children are encouraged to rush around stamping a souvenir booklet with images of the coins, which is fun, but adults don’t have time to look at every country’s exhibit. It is not allowed to circuit again to take in more of the exhibits without a guide. I suppose that’s for security reasons. Could have spent more time here.

Admission is free and the tours are free.

It’s important to note that the museum’s stated opening hours are 10am to 6pm (Tuesday to Sunday – closed Monday). But, because admission is by 1-1/2 hr guided tour, the effective closing time is 4.30pm, possibly earlier – the last guided tour may depart before 4.30pm! To avoid disappointment, it would be advisable to go in the morning or early afternoon latest to catch a tour.

There is a lake in the centre of the park, surrounded by green space which allows people to do activities. Since the place supports outdoor activities such as exercise, walking, and running, and allows art and music activities to be held, Benjakitti Park is truly the paradize for city people. Benjakiti Park is not just a normal green park because It contains four zones of forest which are different. Therefore, the visitors can visit several forests in one place. To visit around the park, the visitors can walk or run along the passageways which are arranged nicely. There are slow runways, fast runways, and bicycleways. Also, there are walkways through the forests which allow the visitors to perceive the forest's atmosphere, which is a unique point compared with other parks in Bangkok. The visitors should visit there after 5 PM because the weather is super hot and they can get burned by the strong sunlight of Thailand. Moreover, visitors can go there conveniently by taking the BTS Skytrain to Asoke station, and the MRT subway to Sukhumvit station. Apart from that, It is near Queen Sirikit National Convention Center which usually holds activities and special events. The visitors can continue their trip there as well.

I called and made a booking with the receptionist, she  said they could accept 1.5hr booking, when I arrived they said they can only accept 1 hr because they need to save time for cleaning rooms. I was disappointed.

After massage I asked for her help to get a taxi for me, she then helped to call Grab. After a few mins she said the taxi arrived and asked me to go down. She walked me down to ground floor and told me I cannot use the main entrance but can only use the entrance at the back. I was on my own and it was 10:30pm I did not feel safe using the entrance at the back, but I had no choice.

When I reached the front street there was no taxi at all! After a few mins a taxi just came to me and spoke Thai. I asked if the Spa called him he just kept saying ""Yes OK OK"" so I got on the taxi. Then I received a call from receptionist asking why didn't I get on the taxi? I said well you told me the taxi was there but there was no taxi! And you didnt tell me the car plate number!

I was very lucky that the taxi driver did take me back to my hotel in the end but he did not follow the route shown on Google map and I felt it was intentional. He charged me 200 THB, I asked hotel concierge they said 200 is too expensive should only be 120 THB. I then only paid 120 THB.

Crap experience with the receptionist, I don't feel they take my safety seriously. Do not go to this branch - aged and worn. Go to Sukhumvit or Langsuan branch - they provide very professional service.

To celebrate the auspicious ceremony of King Rama the 10th accession to the throne, the Royal Thai Navy open Wang Derm Palace for free and no need to make appointment between Dec 14th -28th , 2019.
In September 2004, the Phra Racha Wang Derm was awarded the award of merit in the 2004 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Award for Culture Heritage Conservation Programme.
King Taksin the great founded Thonburi in 1767 after the destruction of Ayuthya, this palace is the only palace built by King Taksin the great in 1768. It was built on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River near the old Wichayen Fort which was later renamed Wichaiprasit Fort. The palace was called  Phra Racha Wang Derm (the original palace) after King Rama the first came into power in 1782. 
Because of its strategic location, the King placed important royal family members in Phra Racha Wang Derm. This practice continued until King Rama V.

I drove to the palace on Sunday at 9 o'clock,  it was easy for me to get parking space. There have been a number of visitors mostly Thai about 60 persons then, we were welcomed by the Navy brought us to Green house to watch a video in an air conditioned room to understand the perimeter of site. This took about 10 minutes, after that we were free to walk around. I could take some pictures showing the building and surrounding. It was not allowed to take pictures inside the building which had a large display of artifacts during 18th century period.

It was built in 1768 near Wat Arun on the west side of the Chao Phraya River before King Rama I moved the capital to the east bank and built the Grand Palace. Even after that trusted members of the royal family resided here in order to keep this strategic building in the family. Finally, King Rama V made the Royal Thai Naval Academy here, with strict instructions to preserve the historic structures like King Pinklao's living wuarters, Throne Hall, King Taksin’s Srine and Whale Head Shrine. The Academy moved from here in 1944. The building was renovated and currently it houses the Royal Thai Navy Headquarters. It undisputedly is a very interesting building.

Feels like going to Chatuchak market but not crowded and not easily lost.  because it is clearly divided into zones  Both the pet zone, the tree zone, the food zone, the second-hand zone and various appliances.  There is also a park that is a garden groove as well.  For those who want to relax with family  or to exercise such as running  It's also appropriate.
 
  For traveling to Sanam Luang 2, this is mainly to drive a private car.  There are quite a lot of parking spaces here.  but never enough to stop  especially during Saturday and Sunday  There will be a lot of people.  Expenses can be viewed at the arrival point when receiving the card.  As for other forms of travel  It will be a bus like 2 rows (written on the sign saying go to Sanam Luang 2) that can go up at the beginning of the line at Bang Khae Market.  It will come every half hour.  Or the bus line 91 (189 used to run in, but I'm not sure if it's canceled or not), but if you take a taxi, it's convenient as well.  Because there are quite a lot of taxis running to deliver passengers and take them out.
 
  For the main zones that I will review  There are 4 zones together:
 
  1. Tree zone is the zone where I come to dwell the most with my passion for cactus.  So this area I will know quite a lot.  The main ones that are there will be cactus.  From the low price to the ten thousand foot pedal, there are some.  trees  that both bloom and bear fruit make us happy  vegetable garden  Decorative plants, orchids and other things, which if you are a person who likes plants, you must not miss this place.  They also sell pots of terracotta, plastic, garden equipment, ornamental stones, and other things necessary to grow plants.  It's all here.  This zone is in front of Sanam Luang Song.  near the entrance  and inserted at various points as well
 
  2. Pet Zone  Appealing animal lovers, including land animals, aquatic animals, and exotic animals here are also presented to choose from.  Although not as many as Chatuchak market  But here there are also pet supplies.  various animal feeds  that we don't have to poop to Chatuchak at all.
 
  3. The food zone is a zone that exists throughout Sanam Luang 2, whether it is a restaurant, canteen, selling food for takeout.  Famous places have popular egg snacks.  If you come here, don't miss out on buying them as souvenirs.  Other food  For example, there are shops like Kim Yong Market to open here as well.  The price might be a little expensive.  But if compared to not having to go down to carry at Hat Yai up, it's worth it.
 
  4. Second-hand sales zone  It is a zone that is located along with the front zone.  But this period is quite busy especially.  with a lot of salespeople flocking to sell  And the people who come to buy things will be clustered in this zone quite a lot.  There is a selection of everything from small items.  From Japanese crockery to wooden cabinets, display cabinets, and large items, there are quite a lot of them for sale.  Or it's a first-hand item at a very affordable price, there are a lot of them as well.

He was appointed as the 2nd King when his brother took over the throne then.

The construction and design of this temple is unique and different from a royal palace style, locally we called this the art Wang Na ( front palace) style. For those who are interested in Thai art, you may also observe this at the National museum which was a former palace of the second king and at Wat Mahatat.

I came across this Wat online as was looking for somewhere peaceful to go - off the beaten track. After spending a month travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - it's safe to say we were ""templed out"".

But this Wat was something else. All month long me and hubs talked about how we had visited many Wat's but not heard a single prayer. So this experience was definitely one to remember. 

We follow the lunar calender, as do Monks and so were very pleased to be vising on full moon night. We arrived at 4pm and heard some ladies mic-checking and immediately got very excited that we were about to experience something spectacular.

Indeed we did.

We were greeted (as the only non native attendees) by English speaking ladies of the temple and monk's, we were given explanations of proceedings for the evening and so made ourselves comfortable.

I would certainly recommend this Wat if you are looking for somewhere to go that makes you forget where you are. Away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.

The architecture of the front palace is different from the architecture and design of royal palace art. From my personal opinion, it is difficult to say which one is better, it's just different. The Buddha statues were collected from all over the country and restored after Siam-Burma war end about 230 years ago. In the past centuries, this temple was restored by many kings and royal family. It is considered as one the important temple in the capital as a traditional Siam capital's temple.

This is a great place to explore and there are so many photo opportunities, we have called in here quite a few times over the years and we are usually the only people there.

There is also a small airconditioned museum with a couple of different rooms and you will find life size wax figures of various famous monks plus Chinese and Indian statues. The museum is off to the far right hand side of the complex.

The massages were done on a table versus a mat on the floor which was nice.  The pressure and technique were mostly good.  My first disappointment was that we were told to keep our underwear on.  Boxer briefs don’t lend themselves to an effective, flowing massage, especially an oil massage.  Next, our tables were together with curtains surrounding them.  This was fine, but our two therapists talked to each other throughout much of the massage.  They talked softly, but it still made it seem that they were not completely focused on their work.  We also had a couple of male customers talking very loudly in a nearby area, and although that’s not the fault of the establishment, they could have been asked to keep their voices down.

5065,3139084,"Wat Traphang Thong or ""golden lake monastery"" is located next to the Sukhothai eastern city gate. This temple was built around 14th century. The temple is located in the middle of a lake and can be reached via a bridge. There are many Buddhist statues and monuments there, but the master piece of the temple is a footprint of the Lord Buddha (created in 1359 out of dark gray stone). The Buddhist symbols of the week days are other interesting things in the temple. Each day has its specific statue in Buddhism.

I was polite and friendly (I am a quiet person). As soon as I entered the female dentist  gave me a disgusted look.

Eventually, after having her back to me for a long time she turned around and said loudly and sharply, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?""
I was quite surprised but began to explain which is when she began shouting, repeating the same thing at me over and over.

I tried to explain that i was experiencing but she would not listen and continued to shout the same thing over and over! OMG, I had no words left. I just wanted to get out of there. I am too polite and regret not shouting back at her and telling her she has no right to speak to people like they are dogs!

I have been to CMU dental facility several times in the past and the staff are polite and many dentists are nice, but my recent experience has been SHOCKING and this dentist really should not be in the profession because she has NO IDEA HOW to speak to patients or people in general.

I am already a very nervous patient in a dentist facility and she has made the fear even worse! I am embarrassed to say I left the dental facility in tears because it was really a shock. I thought that by going to a private university dental practice, that I would be given accurate helpful information but I did not think that it would involve treating me like dirt.

I will now look for a different dental facility to help with my dental problem. A place where you are spoken to with a decent level of respect.

CMU, please could you send your dental staff for customer care training and teach them how to properly handle patients. This is NOT OK. We patients may be able to handle a little curtness, but not to be spoken to/shouted at like we are animals.",1,wish write review private dental clinic cmu offer recent experience shocking please teach staff manner talk patient respect spoken like dog dentist exaggerating absolutely shock lived thailand nearly year first time spoken shouted way anyone especially shocked health professional polite friendly quiet person soon entered female dentist gave disgusted look eventually back long time turned around said loudly sharply want quite surprised began explain began shouting repeating thing tried explain experiencing would listen continued shout thing omg word left wanted get polite regret shouting back telling right speak people like dog cmu dental facility several time past staff polite many dentist nice recent experience shocking dentist really profession idea speak patient people general already nervous patient dentist facility made fear even worse embarrassed say left dental facility tear really shock thought going private university dental practice would given accurate helpful information think would involve treating like dirt look different dental facility help dental problem place spoken decent level respect cmu please could send dental staff customer care training teach properly handle patient ok patient may able handle little curtness spoken toshouted like animal

The hottest time of the year!
Our bad choice of timing.

The locals live and work in these extreme conditions and they are friendly and enthusiastic.

We found it impossible !
It is so crowded,  the stalls are tight and cramped with SOOO much stock, the atmosphere is overwhelmingly oppressive with humidity, strong smells, loud noises, pushing people, squishy floors.... and it goes on.

We could only stay for an hour.

Take away the time of year, and it could be fun shopping there, but not for us.

I would not encourage anyone to eat there - there is no refrigeration for the food being prepped, not for the cooked food, so I imagine the bacterial growth, in that hot environment is dangerous.

5205,13089161,"We’ve been to Koh Samui many times, and so each time we come we try to do something or go somewhere new. A local recommended a visit to Nathon, the administrative capital of Samui, and the port town where ferries from the mainland arrive. From Chaweng, it’s about a 45 minute drive; we took a taxi which cost 800 baht each way. The drive itself is interesting, passing through the countryside and various local towns along the way. 
Nathon town itself isn’t not really on the tourist circuit, but it’s a good place for a stroll; blocks of old timber shop houses in various states of disrepair, one a green grocer, its neighbour a motorcycle repair shop, and so on. It reminds me of old Phuket town and has the same potential for semi-gentrification depending on the ongoing waxing and waning of Samui’s fortunes in the post Covid world. The main attraction of Nathon is the nightly food market nearby the pier, and it is super charming. It feels quite local and foreigners were in the minority when we visited. We did a circuit of all the different stalls before selecting fish cakes (because I have them everywhere) and spring rolls, and a whole grilled fish. The fish cakes were great - they were the dark, leathery, mean variety, tasty, chewy and streetwise. The grilled fish was really, really good - fresh, flavoursome, perfectly cooked. Everything was super cheap. Drink options were pretty much Fanta or water. There are tables and stools to perch at while you eat.
After dinner, we walked to the end of the pier and enjoyed the sunset, and also paused to watch a group of tourists attempt disembarking a dinner cruise along an alarmingly narrow and unpredictably wobbly gang plank. Luckily, there were no casualties.
After that we had a Singha beer at a neighbourhood bar, and then went into a supermarket to load up on Thai snack foods (who can resist spicy lobster flavoured potato chips?) before meeting our taxi driver at the appointed time in front of the administration building.

I understand cultural differences and language barriers so I wasn’t upset at all by the yelling I simply said “okay I understand” and as I reached for a plate he continued to yell at me that I do not understand and grabbed my arm so hard that I had to yank it away. He then proceeded to repeat himself five times, still screaming and called over my actual guide and told him to explain to me what he had just yelled to me 5 times.

After a short time, we anchored off Koh Tan island for snorkelling but there was not a lot to see in terms of the coral / sea life. Perhaps there are better spots for snorkelling that could be considered?  Koh Mudsum (Pig island) was lovely and was not crowded so you could enjoy the beautiful scenery.  Plenty of time there to feed the pigs, wander around, swim and enjoy some basic food and drink if you wished to. The cruise home at sunset was lovely and the boat stopped for plenty of photos. On arrival back to the departure point, a lovely Thai buffet had been prepared which had plenty of choice and was of good quality.

5269,1997527,"Unfortunately the most unpleasant tour we have had in South-East Asia so far. Throughout the whole afternoon there is immense lack of communication from the staff. You get picked up from your hotel as promised, but since they do not tell you anything you are left to wonder where you are going and how long it will take. After +1 hour in the minivan transfer you arrive at the pier where they will check you in and give you a very quick overview of the trip. Afterwards you have to wait another 30 mins before the boat departs. When boarding the boat you would normally get introduced to your crew and guide, but unfortunately not on this tour. After a couple of minutes you will arrive at the snorkeling spot. Again very little information is provided about snorkeling tips, background information on the area we are in or any safety guidelines. However the crew is very clear in one messages and that is that you would need to pay an fine of 1500 Thai Bath (as much as the costs of the entire tour) if you lose one snorkel set. Not to mention that these snorkel sets were of the quality of your local second hand market and where nearly falling apart. If you expect to see clear waters, beautiful coral and extraordinary fish, please don’t book this tour. Visibility in this spot is around 1 meter, the coral consists of one rock in the sea with some dead plants and coral attached to it. It felt like we just got dropped on the middle of the sea since it was on the way to pig island. Where normally you would have time to snorkel for more then an hour, you actually get around 30 mins. Additionally the spot was quite dangerous since we were at open sea were the waves quite high. You risked to get smashed into the coral rock or worse a sea urchin. Again no information on safety was provided by the crew. After the short snorkel stop you head straight for pig island. Here you are dropped of again without any information on its history or rules. The island on itself is quite nice with pigs walking around the entire island and food available (50bth) to feed them. After a little more then two hours you will head back to the pier where diner awaits you. On the way back you will be asked to provide the crew with some well earned tips… The diner was actually one of the best ones we had on our entire trip and somewhat saves this tour with one extra star. However we do not book a trip for the good food, but rather a nice afternoon where we can see the beautiful nature this island has to provide and learn more about its history and background.

5335,17382608,"My wife read about the '100 Years Old Wooden Bridge' and determined we would see it. I am pleased that she made that decision, though like many things Thai, the signposting left a lot to be desired, but eventually we got there.
To be honest, on first sight I somewhat disputed the term 'bridge' thinking it was more of a wooden board walk. Though a bridge it is, as it spans a physical obstacle, the rice paddy, without impacting upon the rice and does provide a safe passage from one side to the other.
The bridge is a mere 1 metre high built as it indicates out of timber, though some of its 400 metres of timber planking has been renewed. This does not detract from the whole vista rather the smell of the freshly laid timber enhanced the feeling of being in the country. 
I should mention that some of the boards are out of alignment and some of the newly laid a bit springy, though as all that is required is a sedate walk there should be no problems.
The view from the bridge is one of endless rice paddy interspersed on occasions with yellow and orange fragrant flowers, their colours contrasting with the green of the rice. I would recommend visitors wear a hat or carry an umbrella as on our visit the sun beat down mercilessly.
There is however little shady spot under a tree complete with a wooden bench for those hot and tired and wanting a rest. Or people like us who just wanted to sit and relax and take in the serenity of the area. 
We entered the bridge from the highway side where free parking is available. I believe that there is another entry point at the end of the bridge behind the cafe/restuarant. The cafe/restaurant is called 'Tatone Garden Cafe Restaurant'. This establishment serves cold drinks and basic, cheap and delicious Thai food at a reasonable price, There is some shaded and undercover eating areas available and plenty of seating. It was a pleasant place to relax, take advantage of the tranquility of the place and enjoy a quick snack.
This is not the 8th Wonder of the World, but I enjoyed the uniqueness of the place, noting that it was originally built as a working construction (not a tourist attraction) to service a need, that of enabling workers in the past and possibly to this day to safely access the rice crops and cross from one piece of land to another, without getting their feet wet.

There is this lay down and relax vibes with very welcoming stalls sellers.
Everything is very cheap.
There is this small restaurant who only do noodle soup in the middle of the market on the Riverside. It's the best noodle soup I ever eat during our 3 weeks stay in thailand. Its not quite the most sexy settings and it's it bare simple but the broth, it is just excellent. I am a foodie and I travelled to eat food everywhere and for noodle soup I have my fair share of tasting. I promise you this place served the best noodle soup.

I also bought great dessert that is not the mango sticky rice that you found in every corner of Central Bangkok and there were just amazing.

In all honesty, we did not do much research on the place we were visiting, so when we entered the monastery we were just dumbfounded in all there was to see!  It was our first time visiting Buddha in a temple, and there were quite a few temples (and Buddhas) to visit.  Home to the ""largest reclining Buddha"", the temple attracts lots of visitors.  In some of the temples there were worshippers kneeling before Buddha, others bringing in offerings of flowers and gifts.  It was just peaceful to sit and be still, and to be welcomed into the temples.

The Wat Bang Phli is an active monetary, so we caught glimpses of monks in their red and orange robes.  There are beautiful gardens, statues, buildings, doors, etc.  So much gold - it was just amazing.  

We were able to walk from the Way Bang Phli around the corner to the Kings residence - which is behind quite a large white wall - so not much to see except for the men standing guard.

5367,16829305,"First time We came here, I would give 3 stars.

After second and third time, I give no star to them. After I checked some 1 star comments here, I totally agree to them. Anybody who would have common sense will do the same.

“This is a place could be amazing, but unfortunately there are full of staffs who want to make their own rules. They successfully created a non fun environment. “

“very slow and inefficient at the cashier. Prepare yourself at least half an hour to buy the ticket.”

“Nice place but they are sneaky.  They play the same annoying song over and over until it drives customers crazy and makes you want to leave.”

——From other comments.

If you have a simple request like my kid wants to play this one (buffet)and that one with parents, the staffs play”don’t understand game” or they really don’t understand ( in this case they have no idea what they doing)

Also 3 times I came here, I had been told different policy for same games. ( basically they want you to buy more tickets but with very inefficient way, wasting MY time only because they don’t even have customer at that time.)
I don’t mind paying more money, but as a business, 3 times different rules? Are they made by individual staffs by that minute? Depends on the staff’s mood?

Some staffs were not happy, some of them are sad and miserable, I cant imagine these people would care for kids. One of them almost slammed the door with my kid’s figure there.

Buying tickets are difficult takes long time. They really build up a messy system. Last 2 times I came here I felt like run away from the cashier(downstairs only, upstairs were fine) they are very difficult to communicate while I feel like they are not going to help with anything even they understand( most them speaks zero English).

The Chedi or stupa was originally built by King Rama II on an island partly naturally caused by the accumulation of sand brought down by flood waters, completed by King Rama III and later added its height to 38 meters by King Rama IV who wanted to show all visitors to Thailand that his people were Buddhists. Over the years the river was silted up even more and eventually the island became part of the river’s west bank. It houses 12 sacred relics of Lord Buddha, an image of Buddha “Phra Ham Samut“ in the posture of pacifying the ocean and an image of well-known monk “Phra Chai Wat”.

In fact, a hundred or more years ago, one of the first things that foreign visitors would have seen as they sailed up the Gulf of Siam towards the Chao Phraya and Bangkok would have been the white pagoda, which then was called Phra Chedi Klang Nam, meaning ""The Pagoda in the River"".

The origins of the temple date back to the reign of KIng Rama II with work starting in 1827.  But he died and the pagoda was completed by King Rama III a year later.

Even later King Rama iV wanted to show all foreign visitors to Thailand that the people were Buddhists, so increased the height of the chedi to 38 meters.",3,phra samut chedi sits west bank chao phraya river originallyit island river silt deposit long since connected island mainland fact hundred year ago one first thing foreign visitor would seen sailed gulf siam towards chao phraya bangkok would white pagoda called phra chedi klang nam meaning pagoda river origin temple date back reign king rama ii work starting died pagoda completed king rama iii year later even later king rama iv wanted show foreign visitor thailand people buddhist increased height chedi meter

5402,4322893,"We have just returned from a visit to Chulachomklao fort after first reading about it on Richard Barrow's website. Our accommodation is on the Khlong San side of Taksin bridge and we arranged a 'grab hire' where we had the use of car and driver within greater Bangkok for 4 hours at a cost of 1200 Baht. It took 45 mins to get there and 1hr 15 mins to get back so we had two hours at the fort. An hour of this was spent exploring the Mae Khlong ship - access all areas and it was fascinating, then there are the gun placements, Rama V statue, military hardware exhibition and Mangrove walkway compete with monkeys, which we skilfully avoided.

On top of all this you can see out to the Gulf of Thailand and watch shipping entering the Chao Phraya river. There was a large seafront restaurant which was reasonably busy considering it was a weekday, we only had time to buy drinks and ice creams though.

You may disagree, but this is my idea of a great day trip from Bangkok and the Grab option just gave us peace of mind that our transport was sorted so we didn't have to worry how we were going to get back to the city. 

Entrance to the fort with all its attractions is free.

We took passports with us as entry is through a checkpoint  but we were not asked for them, perhaps as we arrived with a Thai national who was driving the car. I did spot one other western visitor who was wearing some kind of pass so perhaps if you arrive by tuk tuk or taxi, you may need to provide ID.

Overall, well worth a visit and thanks to Richard Barrow for the recommendation.

The ship - HTMS Maeklong - is definitely the star attraction and I spent a good couple of hours looking around it with my friend. There are no signs or anything, so you have to have at least a little interest and knowledge of naval warfare to get the most out of it, but the fact that you can explore almost every space on the ship makes it really remarkable.

5434,5990443,"Some sources call the complex “Isaan Buddhist Park”. No Thai person seems to know that name nor have they ever heard it. I was unable to find out where this title came from. So don’t bother asking Thai people for “Isaan Buddhist Park”, just say the full name or simply “Chedi Mongkol” – and everybody knows what you mean.

Please don’t ask me for instructions on how to get there. A local friend from Roi-et drove me all the way. The location is approximately 90 kilometres North of Roi-et town. There is no village nearby. The chedi is in the middle of nowhere, so to say. I don’t think you can go there by public transport. You have to go by group tour or hire someone to drive you there. If you decide to drive by yourself, get directions from google maps first.
Surprisingly enough, there was a large Tesco Lotus in one of the villages on the way, just in case.

Shortly before arrival you pass many restaurants. They all sell the same: Grilled chicken and grilled fish, the one with the thick crust of salt – very delicious!

Upon arrival you can see that the chedi is in the hills of a jungle area. From the parking lot you can either walk five minutes or take the small tractor-train to reach the entrance. The train is free of charge and so was the entrance to the chedi. Avoid Buddhist holidays if you can. There were not many people during my visit, but I’ve been told that it can get very crowded on certain days.  

The structure is big, I mean really huge. On one sign it is said that the foundation of the building is 101 metres in diameter and the total height is 101 metres as well, referring to the name of the province you are in (Roi-et means “one hundred-one”). The garden surrounding the chedi is well maintained and the photo opportunities are seemingly endless.

When you enter the chedi, you’ll find yourself in a gigantic hall that is nearly empty. In the middle of the room are the Buddha images. This area is relatively small in comparison to the rest of the hall. The next two floors look basically the same: Huge empty space with a Buddha worship corner.

I am still puzzled over the fact that there is such a huge, well maintained place in Thailand, rivalling Bangkok’s Grand Palace in size and I never heard of it before.

A visit can be easily combined with visiting Nam Tok Soda, a waterfall not too far away. From there you can actually see Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol protruding out of the dense jungle.

Another place to add to your trip is the nearby “Tham Pha Nam Thip Non-hunting Area”, which does not have the status of a national park, but is treated like one and it is under the authority of the Thai National Park administration. It is just 10 kilometres away.",5,source call complex isaan buddhist park thai person seems know name ever heard unable find title came dont bother asking thai people isaan buddhist park say full name simply chedi mongkol everybody know mean please dont ask instruction get local friend roiet drove way location approximately kilometre north roiet town village nearby chedi middle nowhere say dont think go public transport go group tour hire someone drive decide drive get direction google map first surprisingly enough large tesco lotus one village way case shortly arrival pas many restaurant sell grilled chicken grilled fish one thick crust salt delicious upon arrival see chedi hill jungle area parking lot either walk five minute take small tractortrain reach entrance train free charge entrance chedi avoid buddhist holiday many people visit ive told get crowded certain day structure big mean really huge one sign said foundation building metre diameter total height metre well referring name province roiet mean one hundredone garden surrounding chedi well maintained photo opportunity seemingly endless enter chedi youll find gigantic hall nearly empty middle room buddha image area relatively small comparison rest hall next two floor look basically huge empty space buddha worship corner still puzzled fact huge well maintained place thailand rivalling bangkok grand palace size never heard visit easily combined visiting nam tok soda waterfall far away actually see phra maha chedi chai mongkol protruding dense jungle another place add trip nearby tham pha nam thip nonhunting area status national park treated like one authority thai national park administration kilometre away

5460,6467659,"....to be sure of the name of this wonderful local temple here in Hua Hin. I believe it's well known for it's somewhat large reclining Buddha that is located sort of off to the back of the main temple. The people at the Tourist Centre in town actually got the name wrong when I went there and showed them some pictures I had taken. Hey, they were nice people who seemed like they were willing to do anything to help me out, and they did. They gave me an awesome English map of Hua Hin that didn't confuse the names of places like Google Maps did online. And I discovered some new temples to see from it. The temple itself - it's quite impressive. I first visited the main temple area with it's variety of structures and statues. Something was going on here and it was quite crowded. I’ｍ kinda guessing it was a ceremony for a young monk (maybe monks) being ordained or whatever it is properly referred to. Respectfully, I tried to keep my distance even though no one seemed concerned with my presence. After snapping a few pics, I went through what looked like a residential area and found the Reclining Buddha. Here I spent about a half hour or so. Lately I've been try to do a little meditation, Nembutsu chanting, and basically taking a time-out when I visit a temple. I was able to get that in here as nobody was around and felt comfortable doing such. I was also able to light some joss sticks that's been a habit of mine too lately.

And also there was a young man - monk as well - who spoke English quite well and escorted me around for a little bit. This is a very nice temple complex on a hilltop here in Hua Hin.  Some of their signs advertise a 360° view of the area, and there are some pretty nice ones when you get to the top. You know I had a real interesting conversation with that monk about language concerning some Buddhist terms. As well as the Thai I imagine, he knows the English words for some of these terms. What he didn't know was the Sanskrit/Pali that most Buddhists in America use (I believe). So basically, he taught me some English (well I heard those words before but didn't know exactly how they applied to Buddhism) and I taught him (a monk) some Sanskrit/Pali (both of which are sacred Buddhist languages that are similar yet different). I thought our conversation was a beautiful thing. And all you can see here is beautiful too. The large main statue is a standing golden buddha (actually an arhat/disciple) that's so tall it can probably be seen for miles. All kinds of great stuff here: rows of seated monk statues, a buddha here, a buddha there, plenty of things to venerate. Got my meditation in too. Went into the main temple, sat down in front of an awesome altar, and meditated for about 20 minutes while listening to some chanting on my cell phone. An older monk was lying on couch watching some videos on a tablet while I was there; I hope I didn't disturb him.

A former Thai prime minister, Banharn Silpa-arch, who was the local member for Suphanburi, in the 1990s pork barrelled the development of Lake Chawak to enlarge its water storage capacity to 10 million cubic meters, with the ability to irrigate a huge expanse of surrounding land and rice padi.

5482,15089780,"This wonderful nature's creation is in the area of Phu Sing National Park. First of all, ones have to hire 4WD pickup truck (together with a driver guide) which cost 500 baht  and can hold passengers upto maximum of 10 (It should be noted that vehicles other than 4WD pickup truck are not allowed in this activity). Although it is legal to drive your own 4WD pickup truck, you are still recommended to hire a car and a driver because the path is cut through the dense forest and is very narrow so that 2 cars cannot use this path simultaneously, therefore all chauffeurs have to use walkie-talkie to communicate with others.

As our car climbed up the mountain (07:45 am), we (in the back of pickup truck) felt the cool fresh air with gentle breeze. After 20 minutes of penetrating through the rainforest, we reached our first stop on a huge rock at the edge of the cliff which provides panorama view of the forest below. Then, we walked to the highlight ""3 whale rocks"", 3 purple huge rocks protrude from the cliff resemble 3 whales (view from above and imagine) of different sizes ( 2 bigger rocks called ""father"" and ""mother"", while the inaccessible smaller one called ""baby""). This point also provides a panorama view of greenish forest below. 

The next stop is ""elephant rock"". Without using any imagination , it is undoubtedly an elephant! The driver then took us to ""Phu Sing gate"", 2 standing huge rocks at the edge of the cliff forming ""little gorge"" that looks like a big gate to the thick jungle (and fabulous view) below. After that, we drove to ""Phu Sing wall"", a natural vertical rock wall with beautiful pattern. Finally, our last checkpoint was a quirky place called ""Sang Roi Bor"", bumpy landscape contain hundred of holes at the edge of the cliff. Of course, you can see a panorama view of abundant forest at this point.
 
Besides the stunning views, our chauffeur was very nice and provided us some interesting historical facts about this place. Around late 70's to early 80's, the forest was used to be communists' hideout (as underground organization). Some comrades passed away here and their bodies were buried somewhere in the forest. This is why the alternate name of the forest is ""pink jungle"" (bit lighter than ""red"").

This amazing place is ""the must"" for ones travelling to Bueng Kan. Don't miss this ! Highly recommended.

I showed up here around 10AM, hardly anyone around but when I asked if I could hire a boat, someone made a phone call and within a few minutes a boatman arrived. Be aware that not much English is spoken here, but basic communication is still possible. The boat fee is the same no matter how many are in your group - 500 thb. Trip lasted about an hour. Lots of bird life, although it's off in the distance - if you want good bird photos be sure to bring more than just a phone to take photos with. Lotus flowers were sparse, but I knew this before I arrived. The boatman said the flowers come in around December.

Be aware, as others have noted, that if you come from Hua Hin, your navigation app will have you turn off highway 4020 onto an unnamed road which turns to dirt in 50 meters. This is not the correct road. Stay on the highway another few kilometers until you reach Samroiyod 6. From here navigation is correct.

Our trip included snorkelling, swimming, a stop at Maya bay, visiting the monkeys at Monkey bay and lunch at bamboo island.  The boat was fairy packed so not much space to move around but it wasn’t intolerable. You are also allowed to bring your own food and drink on to the boat.

5643,19799292,"Great tour early enough to miss the crowds and hits all the best bits around phi phi. We didn’t have Momo though and I think the trip suffered for it. 

Unfortunately poor English meant we were never quite sure what we could do at each stop. 
They were also constantly smoking and two hungover boys were directed to use the bin in the middle of the aisle rather than the toilet on board. So we had a nice medley of sick and cigarettes

Also the snorkels weren’t sanitised in a bucket of anything, just taken out of a bin bag so hopefully they were sanitised before we saw them. 

Lunch on the beach was the most bland Khao pad gai I’ve ever had. If there’s not going to be a lunch buffet or anything then the food could do with being a little bit better than frozen veg with egg fried rice. 

And as bad as plastic/rubber wristbands are for the environment I’d imagine they’re better than a torn bit of clothing that’s thrown away after every trip. Saw a few floating around in the sea after snorkelling.

It gets quite steep (still very safe) in some areas. When going downhill, make sure your shoes have grip as the slope can get slippery if wet. There are handrails there if you need. 

There is a 50bht entry fee at Viewpoint 1's entrance. The funds go towards maintaining the viewpoint/s. It was also worth it with the thought and presentation that went into the decoration at VP1 specifically. VP2 was also nice and clean. 

The reason for the 4-stars (based on my experience) is because I found it to be overcrowded at VP2 at the time that I went which was around sunset. While I understand that sunset is THE ideal time to go, it would have been nice if the others weren't so loud and smoked so much weed that it made the whole place smell so pungent. Though, I do understand that I may have just been unlucky at the time. 

Nevertheless, the viewpoint itself is definitely a 5-star. There is a cafe at VP2 for you to order drinks from.

5662,14170166,"Now I've done this before years ago so this experience was more for my children. Picked up at 8.30, arrived around 9.30  and we waited and waited and waited. We could help ourselves to tea and coffee. Where were the snacks and light breakfast as mentioned in the leaflet? It was after 11 before we set off. 
The guide was Russian, couldn't speak English much so the whole pre boarding speech which went on for more than 10 minutes was only in Russian. I did question him! There were 3 French and 4 of us the rest Russian. Us 7 did not get any information whatsoever. We were left to figure it out. Very unsafe and not very professional. 

They sell it as a nice speed boat max 30 on board, but let me tell you there were over 40 people on board totally cramped. We had loud, rude and thoughtless Russians on board who didn't care about the rest of us. Drinking alcohol all the whole way. Now the sea was very rough and we had to wear our life jackets at all times. The boat overpacked and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. People were sick everywhere. My youngest was frightened and is now traumatised from that trip. 
We couldn't go snorkeling properly, we didn't stop at places because we couldn't and obviously Maya bay was closed, this wasn't said when booking. Basically the whole itinerary was changed. Lunch was at phi phi don, absolutely awful, the worst food we had in all the trips we did!

So the everythig about this trip, the food, the company was absolutely awful. We came away from this trip with absolute disgust. I will never do this type of trip again.
I have done more personal private boat tours of 6 to 10 people in the past and in future will stick to a more smaller and better experience rather than be moved around like cattle! 

Last note, I can see how much Thailand has changed, its all about numbers on the boats and how much money is made. There were several tour operators doing the same thing. Everyone is trying to sell you something on the islands and you are rushed everywhere from Island to Island. Such a shame. This was not a nice or enjoyable experience.

5664,14170166,"Pirate tour

My husband booked this tour before we left and paid a deposit. He was told he would be sent details of where to meet our boat captain the afternoon before the tour & we would need to be at the place where long boats are moored on tonsai bay at 8am. 
When we asked which boat he said no, other side near slinky bar. So we had to walk to the other beach. This is not a big problem, but we were hot & worried after reading other reviews. 
Eventually (around 8:15) he sent a message  with the boat name. It was a long tail that had just arrived. 
The captain put the ladder for the boat out for us & helped us into the boat. He spoke very little but drove us to a site with lots of other boats & said it was for snorkelling & gave us snorkel each. The boat had to stop quite at away from where we were to snorkel. We swam to the shore & it was probably a bit too far for us without life jackets, although we are all very good swimmers.  
The next spot we went to was beautiful & the captain said “for swim” instead of snorkelling. He was spot on, it was no good for snorkelling but we swam a bit. We asked for more snorkelling & he took us just a little further away & had a great opportunity to snorkel. Then we went a loooong way from there (we were unsure where as it seems like back to tonsai bay!) & this was definitely our favourite spot…Nui Bay. There were amazing things to see & a beach of you wanted to swim to it. If we had more time in phi phi we might have gone back via kayak. We snorkelled a bit, had lunch then snorkelled some more. GORGEOUS creatures to see. 
While here we asked what time we’re finished & he said about 20min so we made the list to the snorkelling & then he drove us back to the bay.  
The captain was always very polite but understood pretty much zero English. This was only really a problem at the end when my husband was trying to follow Robert’s instructions to “pay in Thai baht on the day”. He thought that meant pay the captain, so he did. 3000 baht. The captain was very unclear (later Robert explained he was new to his team of captains) but we were sent a receipt by Robert almost immediately. Curiously, later we found the amount was debited from our bank account also. My husband put a hold on the payment & emailed Robert who apologised & tried to explain it but it still didn’t make sense. We’re still not sure what happened but I think he didn’t mean for us to pay the captain cash. We have read all the reviews & we genuinely don’t think Robert is trying to scam anyone, but the communication is not clear. Perhaps it is an issue if lost in translation, also that Robert is the tour organiser but contracts out to captains to run the tours. This the need to send a recent photo & not knowing who he’d assign & where they’d be.
There were life jackets on the boat but we didn’t need to use them really. If you are at a spot where you have to swim a distance from the boat you should take them anyway to feel more security as the best snorkelling is not always right where the boat is. 
Our captain brought fried rice & stuffed omelette for our lunch, one dish each person. They were delicious. He had cut up pineapple & watermelon for us for ‘morning tea’. He also had a small bottle of cold water for each of us.
This was a private tour, only for us & we enjoyed that aspect. Our kids also benefitted from not needing to go places other people might want. 

Tips/FYI
-Ask for very specific & clear details of how much, when & how payment will be made.
-Take your own snorkel. Two of the ones available were very ordinary
-Some of the islands you could be taken to require you to pay for entry. When our captain offered & said that we would have to pay we just said no thank you.

Part temple, part theme park, part zoo - all weird! The 'zoo' element is weak to say the least, unless you consider chickens and rabbits as an attraction. There was just the one visible croc, no idea if there were others hiding.

The main statues were in an area currently undergoing some serious work so access was a bit wobbly and photographs had to be raised up a touch, but that aside they are beautiful monuments. 

And then there's the Kung Fu Panda statues, and the Happy Feet ones and the massive gongs to have a whack at...

It really is a very odd place, but in many ways, this makes it worth the visit.

5735,6648473,"Started by a British couple and a Dutch lady, Soi Dog is eye-openingly well-run animal foundation that clearly cares for its animals, evidenced by the trust and fondness the many dogs there have for the Soi Dog staff.  We spent two days volunteering and were entrusted with walking dogs, on-leash, off-leash, in clean, grassy enclosures, or a purpose built pool area. They run an incredible operation including what has been a highly successful CNVR - catch, neuter, vaccinate, return - program not just in Phuket but other parts of Thailand too. They have an onsite hospital to care for dogs, there are many sections housing dogs (and cats) according to age, (special) needs, etc. and they do their utmost to nurture dogs so that they may return to their community, or be adopted, or be assimilated on-site. I saw videos of adopting families who spoke of how clean, clearly loved, the animals were when they received their new pet at the other end of their plane journey. It was inspiring and heart-warming to see the kindness and humane-ness these animals are experiencing after clearly going through hard lives, as seen in their lack of one or both eyes, one leg, or bearing scars. Volunteering at Soi Dog is a meaningful form of tourism, and also a wonderful opportunity to meet and connect with other traveller-volunteers from far-flung parts of the world. I highly recommend it.

I spent about 5 hours clanking my way around the place, on what seemed to be a very quiet midweek day. Discovered that they really, really, REALLY, don't want you to photograph the elephants. I suspect that this is because they want people to pay for the privilege. 

For me, the highlight of the place was the Mauy Thia show. It's held at multiple times of the day. I was surprised by how low the attendance for it was. Maybe it was because of the day I went there.

5782,379359,"Over a period of 30 years this was my 3rd visit of Khao Phanom Rung historical park. 

We arrived by car and took a combo ticket for Khao Phanom Rung and Prasat Hin Mueng Tum, 150 Baht per foreigner and 50 Baht parking fee. We took Gate 3 which allowed us to drive up to the top of the mountain, there from the parking place is easy access to the temple. There is another parking lot at gate 1 from where one climbs up the mountain to the level of the temple from the east. I recommend the upper parking lot for those who are not used to climb up narrow steps. 

Phanom Rung is a Hindu-Khmer temple comprising ruins of construction that was completed from the 10th to the 13th centuries. The temple has several beautiful lintels, the most famous being the Phra Narai Lintel, above the east portal, which was returned to Thailand from a museum in the United States in 1988, after the temple had been restored by the Thai Department of Fine Arts.

The view from up top is splendid. We started from the top level and climbed down to the start of the steps, with a brief visit to the Phanom Rung museum, not much to see there. The climbing up is a wonderful experience as finally the top of the main building slowly comes into sight. 

There were quite a number of local and foreign tourists but the area is so large that no crowd  developed anywhere. 

Disturbing were the pigeons, the Fine Arts department should get rid of them as they soil the dark spots and in the long run definitely will ruin part of the structures.",5,period year rd visit khao phanom rung historical park arrived car took combo ticket khao phanom rung prasat hin mueng tum baht per foreigner baht parking fee took gate allowed u drive top mountain parking place easy access temple another parking lot gate one climb mountain level temple east recommend upper parking lot used climb narrow step phanom rung hindukhmer temple comprising ruin construction completed th th century temple several beautiful lintel famous phra narai lintel east portal returned thailand museum united state temple restored thai department fine art view top splendid started top level climbed start step brief visit phanom rung museum much see climbing wonderful experience finally top main building slowly come sight quite number local foreign tourist area large crowd developed anywhere disturbing pigeon fine art department get rid soil dark spot long run definitely ruin part structure

The east access is more impressive, but definitely a lot more work to climb.  The small mountain itself is a long-dormant volcano (yes; there are volcanoes in Thailand!).

These offer you a good photo opportunity to take a picture of yourself with “your” Chinese year. Also in the back is an elevated temple covered by gold leaf.

Many of the sculptures are quite old and worn. However, this just adds to the special charm of the place. Some of them have a coin slot at the front, so if you throw a coin in, the figures will move and give sounds – if it works. The one we tried didn’t.

5841,7159351,"An excellent little museum about labour in Thailand from feudal times and slavery through the times of labour for wages with the arrival of Chinese coolies up to modern attempts to improve the condition of labourers and the lethal assaults on Thai workers and students by the Thai military such as in 1976 & 1992. Excellent historical exhibits touching on sensitive aspects of Thai history such as the Thai alliance with Japan in World War II and the death of so many labourers on the Thai-Burma railway. Outstanding exhibits on Thai cultural history.

The museum itself may seem old and low tech but then it relates to older, low tech times so that’s okay.

It’s at an obscure location beside the railway tracks near Makkasan Station – more than a 1 km walk from either Phetchaburi Station on MRT or Phayathai Station on BTS. There is an office in the back where the curators may be working and the reception desk may be unattended. There is a bell beside the door to ring to attract attention. Admission is free; there is a voluntary donation box by the reception desk.

There are wonderful sights to behold in Thailand where, as elsewhere, we can learn of the good works of monarchs and the ruling elite but don’t find so much about the labourers who were supporting their efforts – this museum addresses the stories of some of those labourers.

The information in this museum is not easily found elsewhere and I rate this as a 5/5 attraction.

5844,14132164,"First things first: The place is NOT in Soi 62 as stated here on TA, but in Soi 58. Soi 62 is just a very short and dirty dead end alley with nothing to explore. And you can see that on the sign indicating the right Soi – It says “Saphan Pla”, with means Fish Bridge. I did not see any bridge though.

Soi 58 is five to ten minutes walking from Saphan Taksin Sky Train Station. Just pass the temple named “Wat Yannawa” – the one with the concrete boat – then the Bangkok Dock and you are almost there.

If you “smell something fishy” upon entering the Soi do not worry! Here it means that everything is fine and you have come to the right place. The whole street and the buildings smell like fish, even when the market is closed in the daytime. But it is not too bad, not like it’s rotten, it is just…fish. 

Note that this is not a tourist place. It is a wholesale market where the fisherman’s catch from the night is traded to restaurant owners and fish factories. There are no fancy seafood restaurants anywhere nearby. There is actually nothing nearby that has to do with tourist places or fancy stuff at all.

But the good part is that here you can see and experience real Thai life and you are off the beaten path. If you were looking for places where no Farang – tourist or Bangkok resident – show up, well…you’ve found one!

To be honest, I missed most of the action. I went one day in the afternoon and the market was deserted. I took only some photos of the beautiful graffiti (all related to the ocean in general and fishing in particular) on a wall near the market building. 

The next day I went at six o’clock in the morning and even this was too late. Only three places still showed activity by working on or selling fish. I found out that the busiest time is between midnight and four o’clock. The photo opportunities are seemingly endless, I’ve been told. But remember: You are invading people’s daily work space. It can be rough at times and you should ask for permission to take photos. In Thai the question is: “Tai roop dai mai?”. I always got a positive response and a smile.

For the smell alone working with fish is not a dream job to have. Some people might feel uneasy when a tourist shuffles along and takes photos of them.

Strangely enough it’s really easy to get here, so I have no idea why it is so quiet. It is right outside the Royal Thai Naval Academy BTS station. The grounds have some planes and tanks, which make for an interesting pic, and they have a running track all around which I guess is for active naval personnel. 

Inside there are several buildings and rooms you can explore. You get an informational pamphlet too which explains the different rooms. Some examples are the gun room

5853,10136951,"I decided to do the Source’s detox to-go program for 21 days in June this year after having amazing results with 14 days of the retreat program last year. Where to begin…

First up, the 14-day retreat program last year was truly powerful. I lost some weight and it helped with a skin issue I had, but it was the results after the program that had the most impact. I felt like I had a new mindset and started noticing lots of little synchronicities. For example, some new job opportunities essentially fell into my lap, I met some very interesting new people, and some small things I'd wanted for a long while seemed to just materialize in my life. It’s difficult to explain, but it felt like there had been a change externally as well as internally.

I’d wanted to stay longer, but had to go back to work, so I decided to return this year and do the full 21 days to keep the positive momentum going and complete the change in myself (but as the detox to-go option, so I could still follow my regular routine).

Initially, it was a little more difficult, and I felt I needed to increase the amount of juice I was drinking to match the energy I was spending on work and going to the gym. Ivor was on-hand to talk me through the process though and give me some recommendations. 

After 21 days (and two liver flushes), I lost 8kg! And my skin issue had cleared completely. Even though the process was a little harder during the longer detox, I finished with a remarkable sense of peace and clarity. I was a bit worried I was too relaxed (!) and had lost my drive a little, but my motivation soon returned after I slowly reintroduced food. Apparently this calm feeling was related to clearing all the acid waste from the body, as it had become much more alkaline. 

If you’ve ever fasted before, you know the detox clarity I’m talking about. It’s not like your problems disappear, more that you aren’t so worried about dealing with them, and are content to let things just unfold. I really feel like it has been the ultimate reset for my body, both physically and mentally. I’m writing this just over a week later and it’s like I have an entirely new perspective. Everything feels remarkably in flow. It’s going to be exciting to see what changes happen in my life as a result.

If you can’t do the retreat program, it’s entirely doable to make the juice yourself at home or elsewhere on Koh Samui and go about life as normal with the detox to go (I did it in an Airbnb nearby and Ivor lent me a juicer!). I highly recommend doing the full 21 days if you can. It feels life changing!",5,decided source detox togo program day june year amazing result day retreat program last year begin first day retreat program last year truly powerful lost weight helped skin issue result program impact felt like new mindset started noticing lot little synchronicity example new job opportunity essentially fell lap met interesting new people small thing id wanted long seemed materialize life difficult explain felt like change externally well internally id wanted stay longer go back work decided return year full day keep positive momentum going complete change detox togo option could still follow regular routine initially little difficult felt needed increase amount juice drinking match energy spending work going gym ivor onhand talk process though give recommendation day two liver flush lost kg skin issue cleared completely even though process little harder longer detox finished remarkable sense peace clarity bit worried relaxed lost drive little motivation soon returned slowly reintroduced food apparently calm feeling related clearing acid waste body become much alkaline youve ever fasted know detox clarity im talking like problem disappear arent worried dealing content let thing unfold really feel like ultimate reset body physically mentally im writing week later like entirely new perspective everything feel remarkably flow going exciting see change happen life result cant retreat program entirely doable make juice home elsewhere koh samui go life normal detox go airbnb nearby ivor lent juicer highly recommend full day feel life changing
5854,10136951,"I recently finished 7 days of the Source new advanced detox program and I can honestly say it is a game changer. What was most noticeable was the speed at which the change happens. Having done the normal 28 day program a few years ago, it was great and I felt good, but this new program works on a much deeper level and in a much shorter time frame. 

 I felt it open up my energy on many levels in mind body and spirit and in a profound way for me. Maybe I was just ready for this change at this precise time. It has encouraged me to make more lasting changes to my health because I want to keep this feeling of being more alive into the future. As I might have drifted back to some not so healthy habits before, I have no desire to do so now. That’s the big difference. The new feeling is too good.

 I did blood tests before and after the detox where there were a few issues with liver, kidneys and cholesterol numbers. The same blood tests after the detox were completely in the normal range and cholesterol came way down to the middle of the normal range. That’s a big shift in a small time frame, a bit unbelievable really and my doctor was quite surprised. I lost 4 kilos in the 7 days and I am still continuing to lose weight several weeks after the detox. My total weight loss is at 5kgs. I did also notice that my eyesight improved and I had a lot more energy to exercise during the program which was new to me as normally on a detox I would have just rested all day. You could probably even work while doing this.

I would say it’s definitely an accelerated program, so if you don’t want to detox for a long period of time, you can get excellent results rapidly and effectively, which has a lot of appeal if you don’t have a lot of time. It’s a game changer for detoxing.

 It’s a more expensive program but worth every penny if you care about your health. I am planning on doing the 28 day new advanced program because if I can get these results in one week, what would 28 days be like? I’m really interested to know.

5858,1390151,"Hubby and I stopped in for our third massage since arriving in Chiang Mai a week ago. Herbal Steam is average compared to the first two we tried.

We like the lobby. You take your shoes off and, upon entering, sit in a comfortable chair and receive a foot bath while soothing background music plays. Next you're escorted into the massage room.

We didn't like the temperature in the massage room. It was warm and stuffy and, on a 95-degree day, we needed cool. A fan on the wall was circulating at low speed, so I bumped it up a notch, which got the air moving.

The tables here have no face cradles, and none of the portable kind were provided for us. This makes lying on one's face very uncomfortable. Unlike the other two massage houses we visited, no clothing basket is provided here to store your clothes and personal items. I piled my clothes, purse, umbrella, and jewelry in a corner on the floor. 

Hubby and I opted to have our massages in the same room, which was a mistake because the two employees doing our massages talked frequently. They wouldn't have been able to do that, had we chosen separate rooms. Talking during a massage is distracting and annoying. 

My Thai massage was pretty thorough, although I experienced a better one a couple days ago. Herbal Steam charges 200 baht for a 1-hour Thai massage and 300 baht for a 1-hour oil massage. I paid 180 baht for the previous Thai massage. Not much difference in price at most places in the old city, except the luxury spas, which charge 2-3 times higher.

The Brits took Burma to the west and the French took Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to the east, leaving Siam (today's Thailand), sitting somewhat bewildered in between.

So a series of forts (""pom"" in Thai) were built at the mouth of the Chai Phraya River, which leads to the capital, Bangkok.

As it turned out, Siam owed its continued independence more to its delicate diplomatic interplay between the British and French than it did to the threat of the forts.

Today Fort Phlaeng Faira is one of only two or three of the original forts remaining, although even it is standing only in part.

5901,7726805,"Wat Prasat is located on Intawaroot Rd across rom Wat Phra Singh, within the old city walls and was probably built at the end of the 16th cenutry. The temple complex has two chedis (pagodas). The ubosot, viharn and one chedi are constructed in a straight line.

The Lanna style viharn
The classic Lanna style viharn that was built in 1823 is a wooden structure, set on a stone base. It has a steep three tiered roof with chofah (a royal symbol representing the protector garuda) decorating the top ends. The panels on the entrance as well as the pillars are intricately decorated with carved flower motifs in Lanna style.

The stairs leading to the entrance of the viharn contain large Nagas (mythological snakes) guarding the building.A unique feature of this temple is the short tunnel that connects the viharn to the chedi behind it. Usually the viharns principal Buddha image is found towards the back of the wall opposite the entrance.

At the Wat Prasat the center of the back wall contains an ornately decorated entrance to a short tunnel that leads to the chedi directly behind it. The sitting Buddha image that can partly be seen from the viharn is actually inside the chedi.

On either side of the tunnel entrance a number of Buddha images are seated on pedestals about 1 meter high. One of the images is a bronze dating back to 1590, the others are stucco and of a more recent date.

5905,1831068,"Prasat Pueai Noi is claimed to be the biggest Khmer sanctuary in the upper Northeastern. It is believed to be built in the 16th-17th century to be a place to perform Hindu religious rituals. The sanctuary consists of 3 main buildings and a library surrounded by a moat representing Mount Sumeru. The place is still well preserved and the lintel depicting reclining Vishnu is still rich in detail. However, it is noticeable that it has been renovated. 
	
Prasat Pueai Noi has several good points. Firstly, it is easy to reach as it is located next to the main road. Secondly, in case that you are deep into Khmer sanctuaries (like me), it is a good starting point of your Khmer sanctuary trail in Thailand from Khonkaen down to Sakaew. You can just use it as a stopover as it is small so it doesn’t take much time to look around. Finally, it is free of charge for both entrée and parking. 
	
The bad points of this place are as follows. The first one is that Pueai Noi is 1-hour drive from the heart of Khonkaen so if you are not actually interested in the sanctuary, it might not worth your time. (My house is 20-minute drive to the sanctuary, so I can use this place as a picnic site; it’s perfect for me!). Another bad point of this place is that it is very small compared to other Khmer sanctuaries like ones in Phimai and Phanom Rung. They are a lot bigger and more beautiful. 
	
Overall, I don’t recommend this place to foreign travelers who have limited time. It is better you visit the other two I have mentioned. Be that as it may, I proudly present this sanctuary to local travelers. If you ask me if I will visit this place again, my answer is ‘DEFINITELY!’. It actually depends on one’s point of view to decide if this place is worth a visit. Anyways, I hope my review helps you guys decide whether to visit or not to visit.",3,prasat pueai noi claimed biggest khmer sanctuary upper northeastern believed built thth century place perform hindu religious ritual sanctuary consists main building library surrounded moat representing mount sumeru place still well preserved lintel depicting reclining vishnu still rich detail however noticeable renovated prasat pueai noi several good point firstly easy reach located next main road secondly case deep khmer sanctuary like good starting point khmer sanctuary trail thailand khonkaen sakaew use stopover small doesnt take much time look around finally free charge entre parking bad point place follows first one pueai noi hour drive heart khonkaen actually interested sanctuary might worth time house minute drive sanctuary use place picnic site perfect another bad point place small compared khmer sanctuary like one phimai phanom rung lot bigger beautiful overall dont recommend place foreign traveler limited time better visit two mentioned may proudly present sanctuary local traveler ask visit place answer definitely actually depends one point view decide place worth visit anyways hope review help guy decide whether visit visit
