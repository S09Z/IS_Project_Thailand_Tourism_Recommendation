It’s also a large temple complex that you wouldn’t expect to find so near to the infamous Patpong.

Much of the architecture of the complex is typical Thai, except that the ordination hall is one floor up and accessed via a double staircase, where you can also see a giant sculpture of Garuda on the facade. Inside the ordination hall are murals with deep intense colours of blue and burgundy after entering past doors with beautiful mother of pearl inlaid doors and window shutters.

The high altar has a golden statue of the Buddha seated and calling earth to witness. The buddha is seated on an unusual curved throne on multiple tiers, with each tier having a different design.

51,2405697.0,Wat Hua Lumphong,Family,5.0,0.0,"Every visit to Bangkok for me is not just about savoring its vibrant street food, exploring the labyrinthine markets, or basking in the electric nightlife; it holds a deeper, more personal ritual. Tucked away amidst the humming cityscape is a temple that quietly beckons with a unique call to generosity – the act of coffin donation. 

This temple, a serene oasis, has become my unlikely pilgrimage site. Here, away from the skyscrapers' shadows, I participate in a tradition that honors life by supporting the journey after it. The coffin donation is a profound gesture in Thai culture, an offering of dignity and respect to those who have passed away without the means for a proper farewell.

Each trip, I find my way to the temple gates, where the metropolitan bustle gives way to a tranquil courtyard. The sign pointing to the 'Coffin donation' reaffirms my purpose. Inside, I'm greeted by walls lined with names, each representing a soul whose departure from this world was eased through the kindness of strangers. 

My contributions here are small, humble threads in the larger tapestry of communal care that this foundation weaves so diligently. But the impact, I've come to realize, is immeasurable. In Bangkok, among the temples and tuk-tuks, I've found a place where I can leave a piece of my heart, contributing to a cycle of giving that reverberates with the enduring spirit of humanity. 

This tradition has become an anchor of my Bangkok experiences, a meaningful counterpoint to the ephemeral joys of travel. It reminds me that amidst the transitory nature of life, there are enduring acts of kindness that define our existence. And so, with each visit, I embrace the poignant beauty of this city, not only through its sights and sounds but through the silent giving that echoes in its heart.

Please note:
1) Write your name on the pink slip of paper to be pasted on the coffin of your choice
2) Receipt is to be burnt at the temple connecting the donation centre after you make your wishes, do not bring it back

She was temporally taken to Wat Ku until she could be brought to Bangkok for a Royal funeral.   The boats involved in the mishap were later recovered and taken to Wat Ku and are currently on display next to a large reclining Buddha.  My first visit was in 2009.  A larger wooden temple stood in front of a smaller modern one . The wooden structure was very old and constructed in the Mon style architecture.  The Wat's grounds were wide and open.  Taxies and cars would often cut across them to get to the river.  WOW! things have changed.  As we drove around the curve This magnificent structure appeared surrounded by a smoothed masonry wall with gleaming stainless steel inserts.  My wife advised me there was an attempt to raise the old wooden structure because of the water damage through the annual rainy seasons but it failed and partly collapsed, making it a complete total loss.   The new Wat is a white building trimmed in gold, very ornate, built in the Thai style, except for the reddish brown tile roof, instead of the traditional orange ones. Inside is breath taking.  There are several new buildings including a huge structure.  I remember the foundation being laid in 2009 and it's still under construction.  But, sadly with all of the new construction, the patio area with the reclining Buddha and Royal boats, have fallen into disrepair.  After all of the other projects are completed, I hope they restore this area.   There are other attractions in the near by, so, its worth a visit.",2,2

 I had a AWSOME experience in the province of Sing Buri. (Funny i ask my wife why every town ends in Buri ) I now no it means town / city. But I'm sure you smart people out there new that 
Anyway it was the 100 day passing of my wife's grand farther. We went to Sing Buri to a family gathering. Good and alchole. Wow wow 
Those Thai boys like there Whisky 
So it was big for them getting the Farang drunk. I held my own though I don't drink a lot. 
On the Sunday morning after a big saterday night every body got up we stayed in grandfathers home were the clay water pots around the back yard were over 200 years old as was the house it was so cool sleeping there for me. 
Scattered around the yard also were old fishing boats very old. I did see traditional fisherman floating down river in these boats but that's another post 
So food was prepared in abundance to take to the monks at temple every one help including the kids. 
The experience next was so cool   We all went to temple near the house and a gathering of monks sat on the floor we placed the food in front of them on traditional trays and silver water drinking dishes. Then they chanted for a hour I think for my western ear it was Somthing I will never forget. The harmonies wow wow wow that's all I can say 
Then they ate Wat they could. Then the children gathered the remaining food and placed it in front of every one else  I was instructed to eat. The food is considered blessed as the monks have touched it. And because they are full from eating this fullness is passed on to grandfather for a safe journey to the next life. 
I was humbled i became emotional i also was getting watched by every one as they had never had a Farang take part in a ceromony like this in that temple. I'm sure others have experienced this though. I felt so lucky. 
It was like a initiation for me into the family. 
Then back to the house for more Whisky. I was lucky my wife dragged me away from her brothers and we went and checked out some of the other Temples in Sing Buri. Such as the temple were the inside is all solid gold. I got to look inside. 
I'll shut up now and perhaps i can tell you guys about that another time. Got to get of the loo now

 About the food zone  There are a variety of things to eat, including savory food.  Desserts and drinks 

 As for the game arcade zone, it's fun to play and has a lot of variety, but it's a bit difficult to play. I think before you come to play, you have to think carefully.  You have to spend quite a bit of money.

 The last zone is the sales zone. There are clothes, toys, and a variety of items for sale at prices that are appropriate for the products.

Its a new area a new market etc to visit, but the Temple makes it so much more and we forget that we are in someone's backyard or neighborhood and its much more to the locals. The market is only on Tuesday and Sunday evenings so the rest of the time it is all about the Temple.enjoy.",2,1

As you arrive with dinosaurs at the entrance and drive towards the large parking area you might be misled in thinking that it would be another Disneyland like attraction but it is actually an educational facility mainly structured for children, but adults could learn a thing or two.   My wife and I have endeavoured to pass comment on several photos and hope that we are right.  

The Wat suggests that all these statues emanate from Thai spiritualism, mythology or folklore giving the visitor a glimpse, as you may be there for only 2-3 hours, of the teachings of Buddha and the better way to lead your life.  I understand that construction started in 1969 and that the monk passed away not so long ago.   He lies in state within the main temple as can be seen in one of the photos.

What a beautiful temple on the hilltop between Roi Et and Mukdahan in NE Thailand. Not so close to Roi Et, closer to Mukdahan really, It is in Roi Et province but right on the border.
4 levels and a serpentine staircase up into the dome. The 360 Outside view is wonderful but inside is spectacular.

A rather special temple and worth the trip if you are within 100 or 200 kilometres. 

And it's free to enter, even for farangs. There is even a courtesy golf buggy style bus for the 300-meter walk up the gentle slope. We walked up entrance 2 and there are many balancing rock piles built by visitors.

For decades, the trees around Wat Phai Lom were the winter nesting sanctuary for hundreds, if not thousands, of Asian open-billed storks.  The scene was truly fantastic and the cool-season nesting site attracted thousands of human visitors to see the fabulous sight of the graceful migratory birds.  The stork chicks and fledglings were especially endearing to observe!

For years, the human visitors spent considerable amounts of money on snacks and drinks and obviously contributed generously to the temple during their pilgrimages to the stork sanctuary.  In a stupendously idiotic tragedy, however, the temple abbot and decision makers went on a huge construction binge, knocking down trees, piling up construction materials, making loud disturbing noises, and otherwise making the area unattractive to the nesting storks. To make a long story short, they managed to ""kill the storks that laid the golden eggs.""  The storks got fed up with the disruptions to their mating and nesting and abruptly stopped returning to the temple grounds about five years ago (various reports are that the storks are now nesting in Buriram, Nakon Sawong, Nakon Chaisi, and elsewhere).

The temple grounds are now blighted by a huge temple building dedicated to the storks that no longer visit (unmaintained, falling apart, and home to a large number of pigeons), a crumbling giant sculpture of stork, and a large empty parking lot.

Off the beaten path lies Wat Samphran, also known as the “Dragon Temple.” It is located approximately 15 min from After the Rain Coffee & Gallery (20 min from Bubble in the Forest Cafe).

There is no admission fee to enter this Buddhist temple. However, donations are highly requested.

Showcasing a unique mix of Thai and Chinese architecture, this 17-story pink tower features a giant green dragon encircling the entire temple. The paint colors have faded over the years, but doesn’t take away from how truly stunning it is. 

The dragon’s body is hollow and is essentially a winding tunnel. For a small donation, you can walk up the length of the dragon, all the way up to the rooftop. 

The dragon wrapped around the tower from bottom to the top symbolizes the “ascent to enlightenment - from sorrow to happiness and from hell to heaven.”

An elevator is available if climbing up a dragon’s body isn’t your cup of tea. However, a donation of 10 THB per person is requested.

Footwear must be removed prior to entering the temple, so come prepared with socks. Despite fans spread throughout the tunnel, it was still blazing hot. 

Since this is an active temple, monks were to be expected. However, I didn’t expect female monks! ALL of the monks we encountered as we walked through the temple grounds were female. 

I had donned a light cardigan to adhere to the temple’s dress code, but it seemed like they weren’t too strict about it. Several female visitors had exposed shoulders and were still able to enter the temple. 

Larger than life pictures of the past and present King and Queen of Thailand are displayed prominently near the temple’s entrance. Please note, it is a crime to speak disrespectfully of the Thai Royal family and is punishable with jail time.

The fairways as like every new courses are well manicured. Fairways are rather wide too and nice water features here and there with some undulation makes this course quite challenging.

During Ayutthaya period, Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) reigned the kingdom and had Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai as his wife. The Burmese army surrounded Ayutthaya by using the invasion route via the Three Pagodas Pass from Kanchanaburi to the west, and then to the capital Ayutthaya. The King  mounted his war elephant in preparation for battle. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai (the Queen) was so worried that she dressed in military attire and followed them on a war elephant. When the Ayutthaya army had faced the vanguard of the Burmese army , Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) engaged the enemy  but the elephant charged away from the enemy. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai, therefore, charged ahead between the King and the Viceroy to block his pursuit and was fatally injured. Whenever the Burmese saw that it was a lady killed in battle they stopped.

(2) the life-size dioramas in its grounds.

This was the last stop for my 5 island trip. The guide won't tell you exactly what is here until your near the end of the trip and are too tired and hungry to complain. They cut down the time on the other islands to allow more time here. We spent 1 hour and 10 minutes here. You need to pay for everything here: from pissing to sitting. The only 2 things free are swimming in the sea and sitting on the rocks at the far end.
The prices are expensive and everything is fixed. Be sure to ask for the price before buying something. Here's a few items they were selling:

- Rental for wooden deck (beach folding chair) - 150 baht for 2 chairs for unlimited time (until your boat calls you back)
- Coconut - 150 baht per unit
- Fruit juice - 150 baht per unit
- Lays chips (small) - 60 baht per unit
- Roasted corn - 50 baht per unit
- Toilet/restroom - 20 baht per entry per person
- Jetski - 1,200 baht per person for 20 minutes (beware the common jetski scam where they accuse you for damaging the jetski when you return it. It was already damaged/dented even before you rent it)

If you REALLY want to go, I recommend wearing a thick sarong over your head/shoulders to monkey-proof yourself a bit, and then also carry a stick to shoo them away. 

It looks cool to take a few photos, but if you get bitten, and I believe that quite a few people are, it's not worth the disruption to your holiday. 

 Rabies is endemic to Thailand, and even though you have a small chance of developing rabies after a bite, you should get the vaccine,  because the disease is deadly and un-treatable.

Never imagined they would bring in live elephants into an enclosed air-conditioned theatre. 

From Thai dances, it later became a showcase of dances from around the world such as Brazilian Samba to Indian to Chinese dance. Kind of odd I say. I rather they put on some display of Muay Thai instead.

The Elephant Show was more interesting. One could pay THB100 for photos with the elephants, and I'm impressed by the animal's intelligence. There were tourists tipping them, giving them cash which they took over with their trunks and then passing to their minder. Visitors can also buy bananas to feed them, which they also took over with their trunks and stuff straight into their mouths. I wonder how they differentiated what can eat and what cannot since they were just taking whatever the visitors were giving them with their trunks.

To get there, we had to go through the jungle/forest, climbing a couple of sets of roughly made ladders. I am about 1.55m (on a good day) and some of the rungs of the ladder were quite widely spaced that I had to stretch pretty high up. We had to pull ourselves up with ropes on a few other occasions. 

We had a ten minutes break from the hike up before we entered the cave. The interior of the cave itself was superb. Some parts were slippery, others were just small openings we had to squeeze through. It was a tough climb up to the cave and a challenging one inside, so honestly, I was not fully able to enjoy the wonders of the cave.

It was an overall a superb experience. What I don't recommend is for small children (in age or stature), or anyone with respiratory issues (cos once you are deeper into the cave, breathing can be difficult.), or those whose stamina is not up to par (like moi) to participate in this activity.

At the summit of the hill behind the temple is another, smaller stupa at the top of a 469 step stairway guarded by coloured, sculpted snakes with a couple of growling whitewashed lions at the top. You can avoid the staircase (but of course losing the merit) by taking the attractive road through the forest, with a rewarding view of the surrounding forested hills at the summit.
This smaller temple has a big silver bell, lifelike sculptures of buffalo and carriages and  a small shrine with life sized carvings of King Kawila and his brother who chased out the Burmese from the Lanna kingdom - however with the help of the Siamese thus effectively bringing the kingdom under the control of Siam.

Unfortunately the temple was closed by the time we got up the steps (but if we'd gone earlier, we'd not have experienced the chanting during our climb nor the sunset), so we missed viewing the inside of the beautiful temple buildings, and were not able to sound to gong on this visit.

Once you pay the 200 thb entry fee, you can visit all sections of the park without extra charge. If you come from Hua Hin, I would recommend this itinerary: First visit Phraya Nakhon Cave, as it's the main attraction. Then if you have any energy left, you can drive to the southernmost part of the park to the visitor center. Here is a short boardwalk leading you through the mangroves. Takes about 15 minutes to walk the circular route. Dusky leaf monkeys can be seen. They also have interesting information about the park, and clean toilets. Not worth a special trip here, but once you have driven to the cave, this is not much farther. Then I suggest driving to Sam Phraya Beach. Spend an hour or two enjoying an empty beach in a very scenic location. More clean toilets, and a good place to eat lunch. This beach, in my opinion, is worth a special trip if you plan to spend the day, or the night (they have houses to rent, or you can camp). Very peaceful. Lastly, you can stop at Sai Cave. Sai cave isn't worth a special trip, but again, if you've come this far you might as well see the cave. Not the best toilets here. From there it's an hour's drive back to Hua Hin, a full day.

So we drove the 140 km from Rayong to Chanthaburi and found our way to the start of the climb, which I must admit with my advancing years, I found more difficult than the last time I was here.

The big attraction is the Khitchakut Temple on the top of the mountain where there is supposedly a Buddha footprint.  Well, you can believe it or not, but go along with the spirit of the trek anyway, because Thais certainly do believe that if they make this pilgrimage they will be granted one wish.

The place you see in the movies and always want to go.  Large limestone formations lush in greenery.  We hired a private long-tail boat for 5000 baht through our hotel.  The boat could be used for up to 6 people for that price.  This time it was just the two of us and well worth it.  The other boats were packed with up to 20 people where as we had so much room.  Our driver was great and even stopped at a private area just for us to swim at with no one else.  The lake is vast and an absolute must see when in Khoa Sok.

Tip:  transportation is not easy or cheap around the area.  The lake is 1 hr drive from the main area with most of the hotels at the National Park Headquarters entrance.  Arrange through the hotel.  Alternative if you have your own transport you can hire a boat directly from the pier for around 1300 baht per person.

The Inthason Waterfall has an unmade road on the right going uphill and an old signboard which is difficult to read so look carefully.  You can drive into a small car park safely.  There are some disused and neglected seating and a building and the site has obviously not had any care for some time.  Those are the bad bits.
If you make the effort you will find a jungle waterfall and dipping pond about 2 feet deep with rushing water leading to a small river going down the hill.  It is a quite lovely setting and looks like something out of a Tarzan movie, were it not for the old buildings around. Not for the feint hearted as the steps down to the stream are in poor repair and the rocks in the river are slippery, so you need to be fairly agile and go carefully.  That said it is a lovely place for a dip and to cool off.
My friends and I were the only ones there and I guess it could get busy at other times, but well worth a visit if you fancy a jungle splash and soak on a hot day.  I would rate it much higher if a little maintenance work and repair were to be done.  It would not take much and make it safer.",2,2

The houses in Mae Kampong are traditional Thai-style wooden homes, which add to the village's charm. My experience in Mae Kampong Village was unforgettable. It's a place where you can relax, connect with nature, and experience Thai culture. I highly recommend a visit to this hidden village in the mountains of Thailand.",1,1
3092,4997640.0,Mae Kampong Village,Solo travel,4.0,0.0,"THIS mountain site is a great way to spend a few hours enjoying village life.
There are the usual tourist stalls but there are also local food outlets, little temples tucked away and a large stream which rushes its way through the village.
Mae Kampong is also a noted home stay village where people come to stay a few nights in the homes of local families to experience village life.
When I was there it was fairly busy without being packed and a gentle wander down the main street involved being occasionally wreathed in swirling smoke from where meat or corn on the cob was being cooked.
There is also a small waterfall, various rapids and it is possible to literally go round the back of the main street homes and shops and follow  the stream downhill past little shrines.
Be aware that the village has quite a steep slope so a chance to relax with a coffee and just enjoy the setting is a good idea.
If you are in the area then I'd recommend a visit here to enjoy the slower pace of life village style.",1,1
3094,4997640.0,Mae Kampong Village,Couples,3.0,2.0,"Mae kampong is a very small village from the mountain in chaing mai. Some shops/ restaurants on the main street, some are behind the main street. Was there on weekday, not crowded, but not all shop are opened on weekdays. Taking example we want to taste the coffee from one particular coffee shop, unfortunately it was closed. Despite this, most of the shop from main streets are opened. 
If you want to feel the mountains vibes or silent, worth to stay there for 1-2 night, many hotel or hostel alone the road. If you never been village in chaing mai, worth to ride an hour ride to get there and stay for 2-3hours. If you’ve been other villages from chaing mai, i will not suggest you to go there. 
We’ve tried northern thai sausage, Khao Soi, viewing the village from cafe on the top hill, it’s tasty. 
If you going there during weekends, i will suggest you to take public transport or hire a driver to there, due to the road conditions. If you getting there on weekdays, you can consider drive by yourself or hire a driver. We hired a driver for half day by THB 1500 on weekday. Departure at 12nn from old town and arrives back to the town about 16:00.

3105,1368429.0,Mae Hong Son Loop,Solo travel,5.0,8.0,"The Mae Hong Son Loop is a beautiful route in Northern Thailand.
Popular amongst bikers and tourists because of the amazing roads with stunning viewpoints.

I can't even tell how many times I did the loop, probably about 7+ times,and I would do it all over again. And again.
It's the feeling of freedom to wander where you want, on not such a strict schedule.

Is it dangerous, some ask.
Be responsible while driving, stay in your own lane and watch out for oncoming traffic, because sometimes they might be on your side of the road.
How about the curves?
Some of them are hairpin curves which can be quite steep.
How to know if you are able to ride such a curve?
As an example you could take a trip to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai. Just before arriving to the 300 steps stairs, there is a hairpin curve with some steepness to it. Now you can determine yourself if you are able to conquer this curve and the curves along the Mae Hong Son Loop.

Back to the Mae Hong Son Loop with some tips, do's and don'ts.
When it comes to clockwise or counter clockwise direction, there is no right or wrong. However, I prefer clockwise because it seems in this direction the loop gets only better and better.
For this ride you might need 5/6 days. No rush, take it easy and enjoy every moment.

After a few days sightseeing in Chiang Mai, it's time to start the loop.
Make sure you have a (big) bike with at least 155cc.
My favourite ride is a Yamaha Aerox 155cc.
This is an automatic bike which has enough power to get you through the loop.
Leave some luggage behind in your Chiang Mai hotel if you have too much.
During the loop comfort is essential, so have a lightweight backpack on and leave some space for groceries on the way.
Always pack a raincoat (or 2, two bottles of water and a jacket. A jacket? Yes, it can be cold up there in the mountains!

Leave Chiang Mai City when it starts to get light outside. There is a long drive ahead. Follow road 108 for 63km and turn right into road 1009 to Doi Inthanon National Park. From road 1009 to the summit is about 50km.
This park is famous for it’s highest point of Thailand, waterfalls, the 2 pagoda’s and it’s garden. At the entrance of the national park you pay an entrance fee for yourself and your bike.
Personally I have 3 stops in this park. The first one is the Wachirathan Waterfall. This is 80m high waterfall and the biggest in this park.
The next stop are the 2 pagoda’s. It’s easy to miss while you drive, so keep your eyes open. You’ll see some parkingspots on the left side of the road with a steep road between them, which is the entrance.
Park your bike and start walking up the steep road, or get the shuttle if available. The 2 pagoda’s honor the late king and queen of Thailand.
These pagoda’s are stunning, surrounded by a beautiful garden and amazing views if the weather is good.
Now the last stop is the highest point of Thailand, which is only 6km away from the pagoda’s. Now the anti climax is that the highest point of Thailand is surrounded by trees, so not much of a view.
Some people like to arrange accomodation in or near the park to enjoy the sunrise which they view from a once of the turns or from the pagoda’s.
It’s time to hit the road and leave the National Park.
Going back to road 108 and follow this road for 135km to Mae Sariang.
Mae Sariang is a city not far from Myanmar.
There is not much to see in this city, but rest is needed since the drive was about 290km in total.
A recommended hotel is Above The Sea Boutique hotel. There is not much
choice when it comes to hotels, but this is the best one. It has rooms in loft style and one of the softest beds I’ve ever tried.
Drop your stuff in the room, have a shower and go for a Khao Soi,
a famous soup in the northern part of Thailand.
After a ride like today and a nice meal, you sure need a good rest.

The second day of the loop is also recommended to leave after breakfast,
Above The Sea Boutique Hotel offers you different options of breakfast.
The drive will be continued on road 108 for 165km to Mae Hong Son.
This doesn’t seem far, but there are many curves tob e conquered.
From Mae Sariang to Mae Hong Son you will see some changes in nature
and here and there some viewpoints will popup.
Get off your bike, grab a drink and enjoy some of the views you see a long the way. Have a stop at these viewpoints such as Mae La Luang Viewpoint with it’s soft rounded hills or Pha Bong Viewpoint with it’s view of huge mountains.
After 165km you arrive in Mae Hong Son City.
My recommended hotel is B2 Mae Hong Son Premier Resort.
This hotel is not far away from the center, but it’s located at a quiet spot.
It’s a good idea to stay here for 2 nights.
Wake up early the next day, very early. Grab the bike, buy some coffee and a bite at 7-11 and hit road 1095 for about 15km, where you then turn left into road 4001 for 25km until you arrive at the Pang Oung Lake. This is a beautiful lake, which is a project of the late King Bhumibol to restore forests and ecosystems. And if you are early enough, you can see the fog floating on the water. Sit down and enjoy the view with your breakfast you bought at 7-11.
Continue on road 4001 for 13km and you will arrive at Ban Rak Thai.
This is a village not far from the Myanmar border built in Yunnanese style.
In the middle of the village there is a lake, which also has the morning fog
over the water. You may want to choose where you want to enjoy the
morning fog, in Pang Oung Lake or Ban Rak Thai.
It’s only viewable in the morning for a short period of time.
By the time you arrive at the second destination, there won’t be morning fog to be seen anymore.
Be careful, because the road to these 2 destinations is very steep and has a
lot of curves.
From Ban Rak Thai on road 4001 going back for 28km, going back on road 1095 (which becomes road 108) for 20km, you arrive at a temple on a mountain called Wat Phra That Doi Kongmu.
This temple shows you a great view of the city of Mae Hong Son.
You can even see the airport from here.
There is a coffeeshop located next to the temple, have a seat, have a drink and enjoy the view.
When you’re on the way back to the hotel, stop by the Cafe Station or MHS Chamber of Commerce. At both of these places you’ll be able to get yourself a certificate for doing the Mae Hong Son Loop. A very nice souvenir!
After you have returned in your hotel and enjoyed a nice shower,
it is recommended to get out in the evening and visit the lake in the city center, named Chong Kham.
This lake is surrounded by a temple, named Wat Chong Kham and a night market. Time for a nice dinner next to the lake with a view of the temple.
After such a day full of activities, it’s time to hit the sheets.

The next day awaits a trip to the city of Pai. Follow road 108/1095 for 105km.
This route has countless curves. Be careful, but enjoy it!
You will pass a bamboo bridge named Su Tong Pae Bridge after 12km on the road. This bridge is meant for monks, so they wouldn’t have to walk in the rice fields. After 10km on the road you will arrive at the fish cave, named Tham Pla.
Personally I am not into caves so I rather move on.
Along the way on road 1095 you arrive at the Pang Mapha viewpoint.
Beautiful view, if the weather allows it, and some stalls around for a drink and
a small bite. From this viewpoint it’s about 10km on road 1095 turning into 1226 going to Ban Jabo, if you are interested.
This is a Lahu tribe village with some beautiful views.
Another viewpoint along the main road is Doi Kiew Lom Viewpoint.
This is the viewpoint which has a view from both sides of the road,
there is a giant swing and ofcourse some stalls around for your appetite.
So after in total 105km you arrive in Pai. It will probably be late in the afternoon.
My recommended hotel in Pai is the Ai Pai Hotel.
It’s one of the most expensive hotels in Pai, but has amazing beds and is
around the corner of the famous walking street.
It’s recommended to stay for 2 nights, so you have a whole day to spend
in Pai.
Have a refreshing shower and head into the walking street. From the Ai Pai Hotel it’s less than 30 seconds and you’ll be in the walking street.
There is a very laid back vibe and so much to see..and eat.
The next morning it’s time to grab the bike and drive 5km on road 1095 and head out to the Big White Buddha. Park your bike and have a morning workout walking up the stairs to the Buddha. Don’t forget a bottle of water, you’ll need it! Once up there, you’ll have a view of the city, if there isn’t too much fog.
4km away on road 1095 and you arrive at the Pai Canyon.
Park your bike next to the road and have a walk up Pai Canyon.
It has some beautiful views, but try not to be there midday, because it can be hot. Some people like to enjoy the sunset at that spot.
There is also another good spot to enjoy the sunset while having a bite and a drink, which is Two Huts Pai. From the White Buddha it’s only 6km away.
After sunset the walking street is waiting for the evening meal.

The next day is the last day of the Mae Hong Son Loop.The route goes on road 1095/107 from Pai back to Chiang Mai.
Don’t forget to take a picture or selfie at the “I AM PAI” sign.
You’ll pass the Pai Canyon again on the way back, and just after the Pai Canyon you will see the Tha Pai Memorial Bridge. In the past this bridge was used to bring trees from the jungle to Pai.
In 1944 the Japanese Army burned down the bridge and at the end of the war it was rebuilt.
Along the curvy road you will pass a viewpoint named Rak Chang.
Not much of a view, but there is a coffeeshop, and you might need a refreshment during conquering this road.
60km away from Chiang Mai there is a small waterfall named Mok Fa.
It’s not too big, but it’s on the road to our destination, so why not.
Back on the road you will notice that traffic increases, trafficjams, shoppingmalls, noise, tourists…and after about 700km, 5 nights and 6 days you’re back in Chiang Mai.

Now this is just an example how to do the Mae Hong Son Loop.
You could do it counter clockwise, stay for more or less nights, have more or less stops; it’s all up to you.
One thing is guaranteed when you do this loop, you’ll experience freedom and Thai hospitality.
Oh, and don’t forget wear a helmet!

3107,1368429.0,Mae Hong Son Loop,NONE,5.0,3.0,"Riding the Mae Hong Son Loop in Thailand is truly an unforgettable experience. The scenic route takes you through stunning mountain landscapes, quaint villages, and picturesque temples. As you wind your way through the lush greenery, you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the natural beauty that surrounds you.

One of the highlights of the trip is the opportunity to visit local hill tribes and learn about their culture and way of life. The people are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and it's a great chance to gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Thailand.

After you are in small waterway to mangrove forest, it is cool without sunshine. 
On mid August, it sometimes heavy rains like squall, therefore you also may have rain coat on kayak.

I recommend that you take a half day tour for Ao Thalane since the afternoon session is different location and activity. You can come back to Ao Nang to have lunch when you take a half day tour.

It is very good attraction in Ao Nang area. If you are active and young, I can highly recommed this activity.

Aside from that history it is a very pretty wooden temple which is also the villages community center so you will see on any given day a slice of rural northern Thai culture going on at the temple also being located in a farming community where still to this day many of the fields are still planted and cultivated by hand offering a great photo opportunity so see the hand harvesting of rice fields by local families.

Was here at a unique time as the country reopens but with a definite sense that even during more normal times this place doesn't get the visitor numbers it could. 

With so little tourist infrastructure nearby it would appear mostly reliant on people arriving by way of their own transport - Not an option for all. Day tripping from Sukhothai (if that is even an option as didn't see much sign of it) risks having ones time at this place rushed.  Best done by foot or bike, yiur barely scratching the surface if only using the tram. The steep hill /steps are well worth traversing to see the sites up top.  

 The point is this place deserves a visit, deserves to be done properly and as such deserves far, far more from the local and national Tourism Authorities (Inc paths cleared to each of the ruins, the descriptions of each of which are often uninteresting  offering no story about the community which built it) 

The place would lose charm if flooded by tourists but still more could be done that could aid preservation efforts, share more of Thailands history and bring greater benefit to the local population.

Something so many elephants are not allowed to do and some of them will never get the chance to have a life like this. The mahouts take such a good care of the elephants. It amazes me every time to see how they put their trust in their mahout, in the strong bond they have created troughout the years. The housekeepers make the most delicious food.

Sellers who sell on boats have a unique way of delivering their wares to buyers. They use a piece of bamboo or wood to deliver the customer's order which has been put in a plastic bag.

Type of shops: Clothes such as stoll, shirts, jeans etc, food such as dried fruits (not dry fruits), sea food, fresh fruits/shakes/juices, shawarma, corn, cococnut ice cream and souvenir shops.

Payment: Almost all of the shops accept ONLY cash. Very few were accepting payments via digital modes such as QR code. I was not able to spot shops accepting credit/debit cards. So make sure you carry an ample amount of cash (Thai Baht)

Parking: Ample car/bike parking is available along the outskirts of the market. I am not sure whether there was any dedicated parking lot. But everyone was parking along the side and this was free.

Entertainment: Live music stage has been setup right in the center of the market with numerous tables where you can grab a seat to enjoy the food and music.

Our instructors, JC and Toey, both had been chefs at a great thai restaurant.  They love what they do and you can feel that through out the classes that they want us to love thai food and they teach us to cook like a thai!

We learnt to make common dishes such as Phad Thai, Satay, and curries.  But we made pretty much everything from scratch.  We made the curry paste with a mortar.  We tasted the curry paste as we made it, so we know what flavor we are aiming for.  We had the recipes but what JC always tried hard to teach us was what the ""flavor"" should be like because that is a better way to learn the dishes.  

We also learn to make some dishes that are not common in America.  We made many salads and seafood dishes that are commonly found in Asia and in more authentic thai restaurants.  Through cooking different dishes, we learnt about Thai cooking and Thai's way of  life.  It was just wonderful.

JC is a great instructor.  She will always take the time to answer our questions.  She taught us the components and complexities of thai food.  She introduced us to all the thai ingredients and how to achieve the balance of the sweetness, saltiness and spiciness in Thai food.

I called and made a booking with the receptionist, she  said they could accept 1.5hr booking, when I arrived they said they can only accept 1 hr because they need to save time for cleaning rooms. I was disappointed.

After massage I asked for her help to get a taxi for me, she then helped to call Grab. After a few mins she said the taxi arrived and asked me to go down. She walked me down to ground floor and told me I cannot use the main entrance but can only use the entrance at the back. I was on my own and it was 10:30pm I did not feel safe using the entrance at the back, but I had no choice.

When I reached the front street there was no taxi at all! After a few mins a taxi just came to me and spoke Thai. I asked if the Spa called him he just kept saying ""Yes OK OK"" so I got on the taxi. Then I received a call from receptionist asking why didn't I get on the taxi? I said well you told me the taxi was there but there was no taxi! And you didnt tell me the car plate number!

I was very lucky that the taxi driver did take me back to my hotel in the end but he did not follow the route shown on Google map and I felt it was intentional. He charged me 200 THB, I asked hotel concierge they said 200 is too expensive should only be 120 THB. I then only paid 120 THB.

Crap experience with the receptionist, I don't feel they take my safety seriously. Do not go to this branch - aged and worn. Go to Sukhumvit or Langsuan branch - they provide very professional service.

I was impressed with the hospitality of security guard waving me to find good parking spot. This museum is funded by department of treasury, no wonder they could afford to provide A/C to the whole building. Entering to the entrance hall and met with a volunteer university students gave me the similar impression, they provided me a warm welcome and the visit was FOC. I was quite fortunate to attend a guided group tour at noon. Not so many visitors, 4, indeed. The tour started by telling us on the history department of treasury, their works and responsibility to the nation, followed by the history of the building which was build during King Rama 7th ( 87 years old) which were used as school for printing and was book printing factory. There were a few more rooms that guided brought us to visit, this area of Banglampoo in the past 60-70 years ago was more or less quite popular to youngsters similar to Siam Square of Central World nowaday. Some of the shops are still in business or change their product and services. After learning about these area by local guide, i could walk around and had lunch and tried special food for lunch in the area.
Before i left i could do some shopping on the commemorate coins , it is a good souvenir for either local or foreigner.
Since English is not Thai's mother language, the volunteer guide might not be able to provide as good story as it should be. I would recommend foreign visitors to  pre-read about the place first before joining the tour either by group or on your own to understand about this place and the Banglampoo area.

I came across this Wat online as was looking for somewhere peaceful to go - off the beaten track. After spending a month travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - it's safe to say we were ""templed out"".

But this Wat was something else. All month long me and hubs talked about how we had visited many Wat's but not heard a single prayer. So this experience was definitely one to remember. 

We follow the lunar calender, as do Monks and so were very pleased to be vising on full moon night. We arrived at 4pm and heard some ladies mic-checking and immediately got very excited that we were about to experience something spectacular.

Indeed we did.

We were greeted (as the only non native attendees) by English speaking ladies of the temple and monk's, we were given explanations of proceedings for the evening and so made ourselves comfortable.

I would certainly recommend this Wat if you are looking for somewhere to go that makes you forget where you are. Away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.

I was spoken to like I am a DOG by the dentist! I am not exaggerating!  I am absolutely in shock! I have lived in Thailand nearly 20 years and this is the first time I have been spoken to (shouted at!) in this way by anyone. I am especially shocked it was from a health ""professional"".

I was polite and friendly (I am a quiet person). As soon as I entered the female dentist  gave me a disgusted look.

Eventually, after having her back to me for a long time she turned around and said loudly and sharply, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?""
I was quite surprised but began to explain which is when she began shouting, repeating the same thing at me over and over.

I tried to explain that i was experiencing but she would not listen and continued to shout the same thing over and over! OMG, I had no words left. I just wanted to get out of there. I am too polite and regret not shouting back at her and telling her she has no right to speak to people like they are dogs!

I have been to CMU dental facility several times in the past and the staff are polite and many dentists are nice, but my recent experience has been SHOCKING and this dentist really should not be in the profession because she has NO IDEA HOW to speak to patients or people in general.

I am already a very nervous patient in a dentist facility and she has made the fear even worse! I am embarrassed to say I left the dental facility in tears because it was really a shock. I thought that by going to a private university dental practice, that I would be given accurate helpful information but I did not think that it would involve treating me like dirt.

I will now look for a different dental facility to help with my dental problem. A place where you are spoken to with a decent level of respect.

CMU, please could you send your dental staff for customer care training and teach them how to properly handle patients. This is NOT OK. We patients may be able to handle a little curtness, but not to be spoken to/shouted at like we are animals.",0,0

Afterwards you have to wait another 30 mins before the boat departs. When boarding the boat you would normally get introduced to your crew and guide, but unfortunately not on this tour. After a couple of minutes you will arrive at the snorkeling spot. Again very little information is provided about snorkeling tips, background information on the area we are in or any safety guidelines. However the crew is very clear in one messages and that is that you would need to pay an fine of 1500 Thai Bath (as much as the costs of the entire tour) if you lose one snorkel set. Not to mention that these snorkel sets were of the quality of your local second hand market and where nearly falling apart. If you expect to see clear waters, beautiful coral and extraordinary fish, please don’t book this tour. Visibility in this spot is around 1 meter, the coral consists of one rock in the sea with some dead plants and coral attached to it. It felt like we just got dropped on the middle of the sea since it was on the way to pig island. Where normally you would have time to snorkel for more then an hour, you actually get around 30 mins. Additionally the spot was quite dangerous since we were at open sea were the waves quite high. You risked to get smashed into the coral rock or worse a sea urchin. Again no information on safety was provided by the crew. After the short snorkel stop you head straight for pig island. Here you are dropped of again without any information on its history or rules. The island on itself is quite nice with pigs walking around the entire island and food available (50bth) to feed them. After a little more then two hours you will head back to the pier where diner awaits you. On the way back you will be asked to provide the crew with some well earned tips… The diner was actually one of the best ones we had on our entire trip and somewhat saves this tour with one extra star. However we do not book a trip for the good food, but rather a nice afternoon where we can see the beautiful nature this island has to provide and learn more about its history and background. If you are looking for that you better look for a different touring company. But if you are looking for an overpriced transfer to pig island then please pick this one.",2,2

Our accommodation is on the Khlong San side of Taksin bridge and we arranged a 'grab hire' where we had the use of car and driver within greater Bangkok for 4 hours at a cost of 1200 Baht. It took 45 mins to get there and 1hr 15 mins to get back so we had two hours at the fort. An hour of this was spent exploring the Mae Khlong ship - access all areas and it was fascinating, then there are the gun placements, Rama V statue, military hardware exhibition and Mangrove walkway compete with monkeys, which we skilfully avoided.

On top of all this you can see out to the Gulf of Thailand and watch shipping entering the Chao Phraya river. There was a large seafront restaurant which was reasonably busy considering it was a weekday, we only had time to buy drinks and ice creams though.

You may disagree, but this is my idea of a great day trip from Bangkok and the Grab option just gave us peace of mind that our transport was sorted so we didn't have to worry how we were going to get back to the city. 

Entrance to the fort with all its attractions is free.

We took passports with us as entry is through a checkpoint  but we were not asked for them, perhaps as we arrived with a Thai national who was driving the car. I did spot one other western visitor who was wearing some kind of pass so perhaps if you arrive by tuk tuk or taxi, you may need to provide ID.

Unfortunately poor English meant we were never quite sure what we could do at each stop. 
They were also constantly smoking and two hungover boys were directed to use the bin in the middle of the aisle rather than the toilet on board. So we had a nice medley of sick and cigarettes

Also the snorkels weren’t sanitised in a bucket of anything, just taken out of a bin bag so hopefully they were sanitised before we saw them. 

Lunch on the beach was the most bland Khao pad gai I’ve ever had. If there’s not going to be a lunch buffet or anything then the food could do with being a little bit better than frozen veg with egg fried rice. 

And as bad as plastic/rubber wristbands are for the environment I’d imagine they’re better than a torn bit of clothing that’s thrown away after every trip. Saw a few floating around in the sea after snorkelling.

My husband booked this tour before we left and paid a deposit. He was told he would be sent details of where to meet our boat captain the afternoon before the tour & we would need to be at the place where long boats are moored on tonsai bay at 8am. 
When we asked which boat he said no, other side near slinky bar. So we had to walk to the other beach. This is not a big problem, but we were hot & worried after reading other reviews. 
Eventually (around 8:15) he sent a message  with the boat name. It was a long tail that had just arrived. 
The captain put the ladder for the boat out for us & helped us into the boat. He spoke very little but drove us to a site with lots of other boats & said it was for snorkelling & gave us snorkel each. The boat had to stop quite at away from where we were to snorkel. We swam to the shore & it was probably a bit too far for us without life jackets, although we are all very good swimmers.  
The next spot we went to was beautiful & the captain said “for swim” instead of snorkelling. He was spot on, it was no good for snorkelling but we swam a bit. We asked for more snorkelling & he took us just a little further away & had a great opportunity to snorkel. Then we went a loooong way from there (we were unsure where as it seems like back to tonsai bay!) & this was definitely our favourite spot…Nui Bay. There were amazing things to see & a beach of you wanted to swim to it. If we had more time in phi phi we might have gone back via kayak. We snorkelled a bit, had lunch then snorkelled some more. GORGEOUS creatures to see. 
While here we asked what time we’re finished & he said about 20min so we made the list to the snorkelling & then he drove us back to the bay.  
The captain was always very polite but understood pretty much zero English. This was only really a problem at the end when my husband was trying to follow Robert’s instructions to “pay in Thai baht on the day”. He thought that meant pay the captain, so he did. 3000 baht. The captain was very unclear (later Robert explained he was new to his team of captains) but we were sent a receipt by Robert almost immediately. Curiously, later we found the amount was debited from our bank account also. My husband put a hold on the payment & emailed Robert who apologised & tried to explain it but it still didn’t make sense. We’re still not sure what happened but I think he didn’t mean for us to pay the captain cash. We have read all the reviews & we genuinely don’t think Robert is trying to scam anyone, but the communication is not clear. Perhaps it is an issue if lost in translation, also that Robert is the tour organiser but contracts out to captains to run the tours. This the need to send a recent photo & not knowing who he’d assign & where they’d be.
There were life jackets on the boat but we didn’t need to use them really. If you are at a spot where you have to swim a distance from the boat you should take them anyway to feel more security as the best snorkelling is not always right where the boat is. 
Our captain brought fried rice & stuffed omelette for our lunch, one dish each person. They were delicious. He had cut up pineapple & watermelon for us for ‘morning tea’. He also had a small bottle of cold water for each of us.
This was a private tour, only for us & we enjoyed that aspect. Our kids also benefitted from not needing to go places other people might want. 

Tips/FYI
-Ask for very specific & clear details of how much, when & how payment will be made.
-Take your own snorkel. Two of the ones available were very ordinary
-Some of the islands you could be taken to require you to pay for entry. When our captain offered & said that we would have to pay we just said no thank you. If you have particular ideas of where you want to snorkel you can make requests.",2,2

The area is filled with horrible sculptures, showing scenes of torture and killing, depicting what can happen to you if you do not lead a virtuous life. It is definitely not a place where you should go with children.

Most of the horror scenes are located near the entrance of the temple. Further back you see more innocent sculptures like dinosaurs and the 12 animals depicting the Chinese zodiac. These offer you a good photo opportunity to take a picture of yourself with “your” Chinese year. Also in the back is an elevated temple covered by gold leaf.

Many of the sculptures are quite old and worn. However, this just adds to the special charm of the place. Some of them have a coin slot at the front, so if you throw a coin in, the figures will move and give sounds – if it works. The one we tried didn’t.

All in all a place which we recommend to visit if you are into such weird attractions.",1,2
5816,10000684.0,Wat Pa Lak Roi,Family,4.0,0.0,This temple has its own macabre theme park showing what happens to 'sinners'.  Some tableaux are even animated when a coin is dropped in a box!  I have seen no other temple like it in Thailand.  Well worth visiting - young children may suffer nightmares after - so you have been warned that this is an adult activity.,0,0
5817,10000684.0,Wat Pa Lak Roi,Friends getaway,5.0,2.0,A lot of horror situations.  Something you would not expect in a temple. Big place and many things go to see and take Fotos. ,2,1
5830,4322657.0,Royal Thai Air Force Museum,Solo travel,5.0,0.0,"Being a bit of an aviation geek I've been meaning to visit here for a while.
An excellent museum and free!!
Used a Grab taxi to get here, have a google map image handy just to help.

A super collection of the old and the new with a healthy number of British types present - Ahh the days when we made aircraft.  Most aircraft are in a good state of repair and well presented considering the difficult climatic conditions.
As you enter walk left to follow the history and progression of the RTAF, informative information and well laid out. Quite an illustrious history and more than I realised.

Some nice modern military hardware outside and easy to get good photos although avoid @midday as the overhead sun is harsh for nice shots (and its hotter too).
Cold air blowers and water refill stations are around the site, plan for at least a good couple of hours+ to do it justice.
A super place and recommended for all ages.",2,1
5835,7809467.0,Wat Huay Pla Kang,Couples,4.0,0.0,"This is an amazing place to go. Pictures just cannot capture the sheer size of this. Easy to get to by car, reasonable amount of parking. We only managed to go at night, but it was so quiet and great for pictures.",0,0
5836,7809467.0,Wat Huay Pla Kang,Friends getaway,5.0,0.0,"This temple is near to White Temple and worth a detour. There is a very large statue of  the bodhisattva Guan Yin. 

The temple is located on top a small hill. If you’re not up to climbing the steps, there is a free shuttle service at the side (near the car park) which brings you all the way to the top. 

For a small fee, you’ll be able to take the lift right to the top inside the  bodhisattva’s head. There is a lot of fans instead and offers a clear view of the surrounding area.",2,1
5837,7809467.0,Wat Huay Pla Kang,Couples,4.0,0.0,"A small but quaint temple inside a giant buddha offers some great views from the top. Can get a bit crowded and hot at times, but there are cars to take you to the top of the hill to save some energy. Nice to visit if you are in the area experiencing the other temples as well.",2,1
5841,7159351.0,Thai Labour Museum,NONE,5.0,5.0,"An excellent little museum about labour in Thailand from feudal times and slavery through the times of labour for wages with the arrival of Chinese coolies up to modern attempts to improve the condition of labourers and the lethal assaults on Thai workers and students by the Thai military such as in 1976 & 1992. Excellent historical exhibits touching on sensitive aspects of Thai history such as the Thai alliance with Japan in World War II and the death of so many labourers on the Thai-Burma railway. Outstanding exhibits on Thai cultural history.

The museum itself may seem old and low tech but then it relates to older, low tech times so that’s okay.

It’s at an obscure location beside the railway tracks near Makkasan Station – more than a 1 km walk from either Phetchaburi Station on MRT or Phayathai Station on BTS. There is an office in the back where the curators may be working and the reception desk may be unattended. There is a bell beside the door to ring to attract attention. Admission is free; there is a voluntary donation box by the reception desk.

There are wonderful sights to behold in Thailand where, as elsewhere, we can learn of the good works of monarchs and the ruling elite but don’t find so much about the labourers who were supporting their efforts – this museum addresses the stories of some of those labourers.

The information in this museum is not easily found elsewhere and I rate this as a 5/5 attraction. There is information here about those sensitive periods in Thai history when news was suppressed and Thai people asked what was happening. Fascinating!",0,1
5842,7159351.0,Thai Labour Museum,Friends getaway,4.0,0.0,"Stumbled on this museum by accident and spent a fascinating half hour there learning in particular about indentured labour in Thailand and how the system was overthrown. Also displays relating to Thailand in WW2, a subject not frequently discussed. Quite old fashioned displays and quite difficult to read at times, but well worth the effort. Entrance by donation.

5852,10136951.0,The Source Herbal Detox Retreat,Couples,5.0,0.0,"Where can I start! My mum and I took only 1 week detox to go program and on the OJ fast. My mum had a bad gout crisis when arrived in Koh Samui so her wrist and neck were very painful. Ivor sprayed a miraculous herbal product that helped her pain a lot, then we started the detox and ohhh! We both lost 3kg , our digestion, skin, our mood and sleep have drastically changed for the best. What I love the most is that after the program, we are given plenty of resourceful protocols to continue our path for a healthier life. Thanks Ivor for that.",1,1
5858,1390151.0,Herbal Steam House,Couples,3.0,0.0,"Hubby and I stopped in for our third massage since arriving in Chiang Mai a week ago. Herbal Steam is average compared to the first two we tried.

We like the lobby. You take your shoes off and, upon entering, sit in a comfortable chair and receive a foot bath while soothing background music plays. Next you're escorted into the massage room.

We didn't like the temperature in the massage room. It was warm and stuffy and, on a 95-degree day, we needed cool. A fan on the wall was circulating at low speed, so I bumped it up a notch, which got the air moving.

The tables here have no face cradles, and none of the portable kind were provided for us. This makes lying on one's face very uncomfortable. Unlike the other two massage houses we visited, no clothing basket is provided here to store your clothes and personal items. I piled my clothes, purse, umbrella, and jewelry in a corner on the floor. 

Hubby and I opted to have our massages in the same room, which was a mistake because the two employees doing our massages talked frequently. They wouldn't have been able to do that, had we chosen separate rooms. Talking during a massage is distracting and annoying. 

My Thai massage was pretty thorough, although I experienced a better one a couple days ago. Herbal Steam charges 200 baht for a 1-hour Thai massage and 300 baht for a 1-hour oil massage. I paid 180 baht for the previous Thai massage. Not much difference in price at most places in the old city, except the luxury spas, which charge 2-3 times higher.

This was fine, but I wouldn't go back with so many other massage options in Chiang Mai.",0,0
5866,6668995.0,Wat Intharam,Friends getaway,2.0,0.0,Wat Intharam was apparently built during the Ayutthaya period in 1757. The old building still stands and houses an old Buddha statue that is covered in gold leaves placed there by devotees and visitors. It is very sad to see such an old and sacred temple made almost completely invisible because of an adjacent bustling market with loud music as well as stalls selling religious items completely blocking the view of the temple itself.,1,1
