The temple itself is built in the Lanna-style, but behind it is a bell-shaped Stupa that is considered to be of Ceylon-style.

We would like to invite them to consider reviewing their #2pricepolicy.  On family day when all families enter for free and with a Thai driving license we would like to suggest it would be a nice gesture to also allow us long term Thai residents free entry. If they could review their Foreigner policy in line with public sentiment and in line with the warm welcome we received across the rest of Ayutthaya, I'm sure we would consider a return visit.",neutral,positive

794,"We got there and changed into the provided clothing. We then fed the elephants sugar cane which was quite exciting as their trunks are powerful. After that we walked a mom and 3 year old “naughty baby” through the woods to the river. Our guide, Nat, was very personable and after only 9 months of English, was quite fluent. At the river we threw buckets of water on mom and babe. After we got them all rinsed they both promptly went and laid in the soil and got it all over themselves. It was quite an exhilarating experience and the camp appears to be doing good work. I highly recommend this activity.",positive,positive
2913,"An incredible view of southwestern islands and other viewpoints such as Promthep Cape and Windmill Viewpoint.

I wanted to describe how to get there because the directions I saw on line were poor. If you are in Patong go south on hi-way 4030. It's just the main road out of the city. Pass thru Karon and Kata and head toward Nui Beach. You will pass Karon Viewpoint hard to miss. Then, in about another 300 yards after Karon View will be the entrance to Nui Beach. At the entrance will be taxis and rides up there. You can take your scooter or whatever you have and do the drive yourself. 

The road is pretty bad in many spots but not terrible. After roughly a kilometer there will be a bend in the road to the left and going straight is the decent to Nui beach. This is where I park my scooter. Take the bend left and it's about 500 meters a little uphill not too steep. You will come to a black rock that says Pa Hin Dum.

The opposite side of the road is another sign, in Thai, that has an arrow pointing up a trail. There is also a worn, faded very faded flag. Take this trail. It's about 200 meters and pretty built up with some railing and a rest spot at one point. Soon you will reach the top and see an incredible view.

Fair warning there is another trail behind a white bucket at the top. I went about 100 yards down this trail thinking it led to another view point. Well, I almost stepped on a snake and they have poisonous snakes. Luckily he darted away so that convinced me to go back to the main trail.",positive,positive

The theatre was made to resemble a broadway theatre and to attract live broadway plays and other theatrical events.  The seating, acoustic, and viewing is fantastic.  I saw the original broadway cast doing Chicago, and the sound and lighting was perfect.  The problem is that there is barely one play per year.  To get to the theatre take the MRT subway to the Thailand Cultural Center station and take exit 3.  Walk a short distance to the Esplanade Shopping Mall and go to the top floor.  There is a ticket counter, also a Thai Ticket major ticket counter, small restaurant and waiting area, and restrooms, then up the escalator to the theatre.

2918,"When Loei people invite tourists to go “rafting,” they aren’t talking white water in raging rivers. They mean flat boats made with bamboo moored in the center of a placid lake. The experience is actually very relaxing and quite soothing during the hotter months. In addition to a nice view, there is a constant, subtle breeze to keep you cool and keep the insects at bay.

We always combined our trips with a meal - the restaurant will bring the food out to you.

Constructed during the long reign of King Chulalongkorn who spent months in Europe (helping Thailand become the only SEA country to escape colonialism), the temple's décor isn't as exuberant as Catholic churches in Europe, but is still interesting for the combination of Buddhist and Christian elements, e.g. Buddha images standing on the altar.

But there is some very commercial fund raising going on, donate to spinning monks with offering bowls and stick a tiny piece of gold paper on now golden balls  even the fat Buddha has a coin slot in his belly button or is it to clean the lint?

We were really impressed by the efforts at conservation and recycling.  You may take water with you on the hike to the waterfall, but no food.  This is to reduce the litter left in the park, so be prepared to either eat before you start hiking, or to check your food in at the kiosk.  We visited in the dry season, and imagine that in the wet season this would be quite spectacular, though not without risk.  After the first pool the hike is rocky and steep, you will need sturdy footwear and a good level of fitness.  At level 3 you can have a swim to cool off.

How we got there:
At the Chang Phueak Gate Night Market (search Google maps for this) there are red truck ""taxis"" near the 7-11 store charging 60THB/person to go to Doi Suthep, and the same to go back down. You don't have to use the same red truck going down as you did going up (if you ask to go all the way to Khun Chang Khien, they'll want 400THB/person to go up, and the same to go back down. We didn't do this because it's more costly). You'll need to wait about 30 minutes until there are 12 people ready to go up before the red truck will leave. It'll take you up to Doi Suthep. You can visit Doi Suthep for awhile if you like. Then take another red truck up to Khun Chang Khian where the blossoms are. The cost is listed on a sign at 200THB/person, one way. We negotiated it to 150THB, and didn't need to wait for the truck to be fill up (we were a party of 3). The driver took us up, we enjoyed the park (no fixed time restrictions), then took us back down to Doi Suthep. We paid another red truck 60THB/person to go back down to Chang Phueak Gate Night Market.",positive,positive

But the unusual part is that around the back side you can enter inside the Buddha sculpture.  At the top of four flights of narrow stairs, you reach a gold-leaf-lined ""heart"" of the Buddha.  Even more fascinating for me were the painted scenes and warnings of what can befall people who fail to lead a respectable life.  Very interesting!  Lots of parking at the temple and no entry charges.",neutral,positive

530,"This temple is lovely and most definitely worth a visit. It's a Khmer prang done with a slightly modern aesthetic. It was built as a memorial to a well loved and respected local monk. The red sandstone is simply mesmerizing at sunset, the best time to visit.
The grounds are lovely, the whole place bears spending some time in reflection and meditation.  Not far from the Amari Buriram Hotel, where I was always stay. but will be hard to get to without your own wheels. 
I highly recommend using a local driver I use when I'm in Buriram, Khun Oi.
She's an excellent driver, knows the area well, has great english. Khun Oi is a lovely tour guide, driver and negotiator.
Booking a trip to Wat Khao Noi (which Khun Oi turned me onto) can be combined to a trip to Huai Chorakhe Mak,  
Huai Chorakhe Mak is a lovely wildlife preserve built on two lakes. They're are bridged by a lovely long walkway along the water front, simply spectacular. There's a lovely path that rings the lakes and you can rent bikes there and do the route easily on a bike. I just love this place and visit each time I'm in Buriram.  Also gorgeous at sunset and not far from Wat Khao Noi, just on the other side of the highway really.

4088,"Suan Son is one of a chain of beaches stretching west to east along Rayong Province's coastline with the Gulf of Thailand.

Suan Son in Thai means Park of Pines, so called because of the stately Casuarina Pines that line the back of the beach and the other side of the beach service road.

The beach aside, one of the things that always strikes me is the drive along the service road through an arboreal archway of Casuarina Pines.  Sometimes, but unfortunately not today, the sunbeams penetrate the overhead canopy and strike down through the foliage to the roadway in a spectacular light show.

4661,"Just went to Bangkok on business and had a half day free so decided to try out a cooking class.  

This class was great.  The cooking school is located of KhaoSan Road, fairly easy to find.  The teacher JC was great.  The class only had 8 people and the recipes I wanted to learn were covered.  The class started with some information about Thai cooking and then a demonstration  and tasting of the things we were going to learn to make.  Then we each went to our woks and were assisted in making 4 dishes - Tom Yum soup, Stir fried chicken with cashew nut, fried rice and green curry.  We also learnt how to make the paste for green and red curry.  

I would highly recommend this cooking school.  Lots of great advise was given about substitutions for vegetables etc that you may not be able to get in your home country.  Looking forward to trying out these recipes at home now and with the training I got, I'm sure it will be possible once I find the ingredients.",positive,positive

Then, we wandered around the place taking some photos, watching a cultural dance performed by local children, shopping at the a little community market. Next, we visited a Thai-Lanna teak house which operates as a museum. Inside the museum, there are a wax model of the first abbot, old photos, ancient artifacts, silverware, rare stones. Subsequently, we chilled out and had some drinks a coffee shop on the terrace behind the main hall. There are many nice spots to take photos such as a traditional Lanna hut in the front of the temple, twin palm trees, or a viewpoint behind the main hall where you can see a beautiful view of greenish rice field and bamboo weave bridge with mountainous background. We also took a stroll on this bamboo bridge over the rice field to another cafe and a little market that sells clothes. Highly Recommend!",positive,positive

The drinks are so creative and my favourites are the signature classic Thai tea ice drink and butterfly pea, passionate fruit and wild honey drink. My favourite dishes are their pad Thai, turmeric fish + brown rice, grilled seabass with pumkin puree and to finish the brownie and chocolate ice cream.

3289,"We booked a 2 night/3 day tour (first night at a farm stay in Khao Sok village and second night was the lake tour staying in floating bungalows). 
The farm stay was average: pretty farm and bungalows but not much to do other than the canoeing or night safari (you can’t do both). Food portions were small and water not included. 
The lake tour was the worst part. We booked the group tour, expecting 6-10 people, but there were over 30 people in one group. We didn’t do anything until 3/4pm because of the amount of people and poor organisation. There was so much waiting around. When we arrived at the lake there weren’t enough bungalows, so they told us to sleep on the floor in the reception area which had no roof or curtains (it was all glass so you have no privacy). The toilets were overflowing with waste and there was no soap. After complaining several times, we were moved to a different bungalow which was much nicer (although wasted even more time), and we enjoyed the swimming and kayaking. We were then promised a trek which turned out to be just a 500m walk, and we couldn’t hear anything the guide was saying because there were so many people. This tour operator also charges far more than others do. We met people on the same tour as us who paid only  2,300 baht for the lake tour. Finally, the tour is advertised as 3 days but really it’s only 2 because they made us leave the lake at 10am on the 3rd day.

5853,"I decided to do the Source’s detox to-go program for 21 days in June this year after having amazing results with 14 days of the retreat program last year. Where to begin…

First up, the 14-day retreat program last year was truly powerful. I lost some weight and it helped with a skin issue I had, but it was the results after the program that had the most impact. I felt like I had a new mindset and started noticing lots of little synchronicities. For example, some new job opportunities essentially fell into my lap, I met some very interesting new people, and some small things I'd wanted for a long while seemed to just materialize in my life. It’s difficult to explain, but it felt like there had been a change externally as well as internally.

I’d wanted to stay longer, but had to go back to work, so I decided to return this year and do the full 21 days to keep the positive momentum going and complete the change in myself (but as the detox to-go option, so I could still follow my regular routine).

Initially, it was a little more difficult, and I felt I needed to increase the amount of juice I was drinking to match the energy I was spending on work and going to the gym. Ivor was on-hand to talk me through the process though and give me some recommendations. 

After 21 days (and two liver flushes), I lost 8kg! And my skin issue had cleared completely. Even though the process was a little harder during the longer detox, I finished with a remarkable sense of peace and clarity. I was a bit worried I was too relaxed (!) and had lost my drive a little, but my motivation soon returned after I slowly reintroduced food. Apparently this calm feeling was related to clearing all the acid waste from the body, as it had become much more alkaline. 

If you’ve ever fasted before, you know the detox clarity I’m talking about. It’s not like your problems disappear, more that you aren’t so worried about dealing with them, and are content to let things just unfold. I really feel like it has been the ultimate reset for my body, both physically and mentally. I’m writing this just over a week later and it’s like I have an entirely new perspective. Everything feels remarkably in flow. It’s going to be exciting to see what changes happen in my life as a result.

If you can’t do the retreat program, it’s entirely doable to make the juice yourself at home or elsewhere on Koh Samui and go about life as normal with the detox to go (I did it in an Airbnb nearby and Ivor lent me a juicer!). I highly recommend doing the full 21 days if you can. It feels life changing!",positive,positive

She was temporally taken to Wat Ku until she could be brought to Bangkok for a Royal funeral.   The boats involved in the mishap were later recovered and taken to Wat Ku and are currently on display next to a large reclining Buddha.  My first visit was in 2009.  A larger wooden temple stood in front of a smaller modern one . The wooden structure was very old and constructed in the Mon style architecture.  The Wat's grounds were wide and open.  Taxies and cars would often cut across them to get to the river.  WOW! things have changed.  As we drove around the curve This magnificent structure appeared surrounded by a smoothed masonry wall with gleaming stainless steel inserts.  My wife advised me there was an attempt to raise the old wooden structure because of the water damage through the annual rainy seasons but it failed and partly collapsed, making it a complete total loss.   The new Wat is a white building trimmed in gold, very ornate, built in the Thai style, except for the reddish brown tile roof, instead of the traditional orange ones. Inside is breath taking.  There are several new buildings including a huge structure.  I remember the foundation being laid in 2009 and it's still under construction.  But, sadly with all of the new construction, the patio area with the reclining Buddha and Royal boats, have fallen into disrepair.  After all of the other projects are completed, I hope they restore this area.   There are other attractions in the near by, so, its worth a visit.",positive,positive

We talked to one of the long boat drivers, who called ""his buddy"" with another long boat and they had us drive over to Klong Muang Beach to meet this boat. He took us to Hong Island - with snorkel gear - and dropped us off. The place had hardly any visitors! We were shocked and amazed! The ""trick"" is to get there close to lunch time when the tours are getting ready to head back from the morning. They don't go out there in the afternoons. We spent almost 6 carefree hours here enjoying ourselves, swimming and walking through the park. There is a small snack shack, but definitely pack a bag of food to go with you. There's a ton of picnic tables and trash cans as well. When we were ready to go, we just walked out to the pier and our Long Boat driver saw us and came up to get us. Definitely a better way to visit than going through a tour company. Make sure to tip your driver heavily since he's literally sitting out in his boat doing nothing but waiting for you to return.",positive,neutral

This Wat reminds me of Disneyland’s Magic Kingdom offering fairy-tale lighting, dragons & mythical beings.  Whilst it is still under construction there is no shortage of curio stalls, not only at the entrance to the Naga cave but within as well.  Whilst we were there 5 bus loads of young, well behaved students arrived and we noticed that their phones were working overtime taking a myriad of photos.  It confirms a suggestion that it is a learning center for Buddhist history in the making.

This “temple” is not my idea of a facility for worship but as an “entertainment” or educational area it would work quite well.  My elderly Thai friends were circumspect in their comments.",positive,neutral

5735,"Started by a British couple and a Dutch lady, Soi Dog is eye-openingly well-run animal foundation that clearly cares for its animals, evidenced by the trust and fondness the many dogs there have for the Soi Dog staff.  We spent two days volunteering and were entrusted with walking dogs, on-leash, off-leash, in clean, grassy enclosures, or a purpose built pool area. They run an incredible operation including what has been a highly successful CNVR - catch, neuter, vaccinate, return - program not just in Phuket but other parts of Thailand too. They have an onsite hospital to care for dogs, there are many sections housing dogs (and cats) according to age, (special) needs, etc. and they do their utmost to nurture dogs so that they may return to their community, or be adopted, or be assimilated on-site. I saw videos of adopting families who spoke of how clean, clearly loved, the animals were when they received their new pet at the other end of their plane journey. It was inspiring and heart-warming to see the kindness and humane-ness these animals are experiencing after clearly going through hard lives, as seen in their lack of one or both eyes, one leg, or bearing scars. Volunteering at Soi Dog is a meaningful form of tourism, and also a wonderful opportunity to meet and connect with other traveller-volunteers from far-flung parts of the world. I highly recommend it. It will enrich your holiday in Phuket. And you will, like us, want to return to Phuket and Soi Dog. Big shout out to the amazing staff and full-time volunteers at Soi Dog!",positive,positive

We first fed the elephants, walked a beautiful route in the nature and then washed and scrubbed the elephants in the lake with the clothes, hats and boots we were given.

Caved-in roofs, peeling paint, derelict buildings, closed and unmaintained walkways, intrusive garish tourist signs, poorly-designed development...the list is nearly endless. 

Somewhere in the last 14 years, overdevelopment for tourists followed by speedy dilapidation has ruined the place.  ""Maintenance"" is now a foreign concept here, and is leading to a quick demise of this once-beautiful destination.",negative,positive

My recommendation is to arrive at 1am or later as before that it is empty.

Apparently the bar goes through different phases during the week, and I happened to end up there on a very gay night.  No matter for me as most of the patrons were very cool and tolerant of straight people.  One or two were infamous perverts though and needed to be hit with a spray bottle.

I didn't get any guff from Wong or his staff. I imagine he was too busy to hassle everyone as the bar was full and everybody was buying drinks.  Yes, he did have a flashlight pointed at your face when he talked to you and I can't work out why.

It surely isn't as bad as it apparently once was.  It is a proper dive bar and social atmosphere.",neutral,positive
5269,"Unfortunately the most unpleasant tour we have had in South-East Asia so far. Throughout the whole afternoon there is immense lack of communication from the staff. You get picked up from your hotel as promised, but since they do not tell you anything you are left to wonder where you are going and how long it will take. After +1 hour in the minivan transfer you arrive at the pier where they will check you in and give you a very quick overview of the trip. Afterwards you have to wait another 30 mins before the boat departs. When boarding the boat you would normally get introduced to your crew and guide, but unfortunately not on this tour. After a couple of minutes you will arrive at the snorkeling spot. Again very little information is provided about snorkeling tips, background information on the area we are in or any safety guidelines. However the crew is very clear in one messages and that is that you would need to pay an fine of 1500 Thai Bath (as much as the costs of the entire tour) if you lose one snorkel set. Not to mention that these snorkel sets were of the quality of your local second hand market and where nearly falling apart. If you expect to see clear waters, beautiful coral and extraordinary fish, please don’t book this tour. Visibility in this spot is around 1 meter, the coral consists of one rock in the sea with some dead plants and coral attached to it. It felt like we just got dropped on the middle of the sea since it was on the way to pig island. Where normally you would have time to snorkel for more then an hour, you actually get around 30 mins. Additionally the spot was quite dangerous since we were at open sea were the waves quite high. You risked to get smashed into the coral rock or worse a sea urchin. Again no information on safety was provided by the crew. After the short snorkel stop you head straight for pig island. Here you are dropped of again without any information on its history or rules. The island on itself is quite nice with pigs walking around the entire island and food available (50bth) to feed them. After a little more then two hours you will head back to the pier where diner awaits you. On the way back you will be asked to provide the crew with some well earned tips… The diner was actually one of the best ones we had on our entire trip and somewhat saves this tour with one extra star. However we do not book a trip for the good food, but rather a nice afternoon where we can see the beautiful nature this island has to provide and learn more about its history and background. If you are looking for that you better look for a different touring company. But if you are looking for an overpriced transfer to pig island then please pick this one.",negative,positive

308,"Hi there folks  well i am in Chiang Mai sitting on the loo thin hung about my month in Thailand. 
 I had a AWSOME experience in the province of Sing Buri. (Funny i ask my wife why every town ends in Buri ) I now no it means town / city. But I'm sure you smart people out there new that 
Anyway it was the 100 day passing of my wife's grand farther. We went to Sing Buri to a family gathering. Good and alchole. Wow wow 
Those Thai boys like there Whisky 
So it was big for them getting the Farang drunk. I held my own though I don't drink a lot. 
On the Sunday morning after a big saterday night every body got up we stayed in grandfathers home were the clay water pots around the back yard were over 200 years old as was the house it was so cool sleeping there for me. 
Scattered around the yard also were old fishing boats very old. I did see traditional fisherman floating down river in these boats but that's another post 
So food was prepared in abundance to take to the monks at temple every one help including the kids. 
The experience next was so cool   We all went to temple near the house and a gathering of monks sat on the floor we placed the food in front of them on traditional trays and silver water drinking dishes. Then they chanted for a hour I think for my western ear it was Somthing I will never forget. The harmonies wow wow wow that's all I can say 
Then they ate Wat they could. Then the children gathered the remaining food and placed it in front of every one else  I was instructed to eat. The food is considered blessed as the monks have touched it. And because they are full from eating this fullness is passed on to grandfather for a safe journey to the next life. 
I was humbled i became emotional i also was getting watched by every one as they had never had a Farang take part in a ceromony like this in that temple. I'm sure others have experienced this though. I felt so lucky. 
It was like a initiation for me into the family. 
Then back to the house for more Whisky. I was lucky my wife dragged me away from her brothers and we went and checked out some of the other Temples in Sing Buri. Such as the temple were the inside is all solid gold. I got to look inside. 
I'll shut up now and perhaps i can tell you guys about that another time. Got to get of the loo now

The only toilets are located at the parking area. They were clean enough and had both squat and sit down style with water hose, but no paper or soap. The hike to the falls is around 3km round trip from the parking area. It's a little steep in some areas but easily achieved without training or special footwear. When you first pass under the entry sign, the trail splits left and right. Both trails end up at the waterfall, so you can take one path on the way up and the other path on the way down. And when you get about 200 meters from the waterfall the trail splits again, with both trails ending at the waterfall. The trail is well marked and well maintained all the way. It is slippery around the falls, as the water drops with such force that a misty wind is created and everything here is wet. The only negative I could add is that there isn't much space around the falls, so if it's crowded you may have to wait a bit for photos. Warning signs for snakes, but I didn't see any here on this day. I have seen the green pit vipers at other locations nearby though, so it's good to keep an eye out for them. ",positive,positive

Its a quite place. Given the low footfall, there aren't many sewadars. They do have some dining tables setup on the ground floor, I assume they are for Langar.

Parking can be a bit of a problem here. Although on one of the posters in inside the gurudwara for an upcoming event, it was mentioned that parking space has been reserved in the nearby hotel. I (along with a friend of mine) had visited around noon, and co-incidentally it was an even date so we were able to park our car along the road in-front of the gurudwara.

The snorkelling was a bit underwhelming with poor visibility and therefore little to see which was a shame.

932,"Dream World review 
 I had the opportunity to go to Dream World on my first field trip there.  I travel late in the morning.  From the beginning is  Dipangkornwittayapat (Taweewattana) Under the Royal Patronage of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn School go to Dream World using a tour bus, which takes 1-3 hours to travel. 

 When I arrived, I walked around Dream World with my group of friends.  In terms of the player  I like all the rides, but the rides that have oil will make you wet. I recommend that before going to Dream World people bring a raincoat as it will make you less wet or not at all. 

 About the food zone  There are a variety of things to eat, including savory food.  Desserts and drinks 

 As for the game arcade zone, it's fun to play and has a lot of variety, but it's a bit difficult to play. I think before you come to play, you have to think carefully.  You have to spend quite a bit of money.

 The last zone is the sales zone. There are clothes, toys, and a variety of items for sale at prices that are appropriate for the products.

 The important thing in the bathroom is that it is clean and pleasant to use.  and others to buy in large quantities.  I came home satisfied after playing at Dream World. It was a great experience for me.",positive,positive

Actually, I would elevate it to being one of Thailand's greatest (albeit a bit off the beaten path for some) sightseeing attractions.

I reckon you also categorise a visit here, under the umbrella of adventure tourism.

Well it was not an easy ascent, to be honest, it was a bit harum-scarum, along the way up, in some sections of the path.

It is always great to make it to the top and the panoramic views were worth it. 😎

However, getting back down, well at times, I felt genuinely anxious. 

I made it (of course) and was rewarded with a relaxing time spent in the lush botanical gardens, as well as checking out even more of the impressive grounds and surrounds that lay at the base of the temple complex.

Some say that Wat Phu Tok is the pride of Bueng Kan and, I reckon that if you are in the province exploring, it is more than well worth a visit.",positive,positive

The stop for Wat Arun is Ta Tian (Tian ferry dock), you can simply tell the cashier when you go to the ferry dock and they can help. Once you are on the boat, just tell the usher, they are very helpful. So, from Ta Tian, take a short walk to the next pier from crossing river, take a ferry cross to Wat Arun. This one cost 5 Bahts.

We rode there on a motorbike and parked easily. The latter part if the road there is gravel, so don’t be put off and think you e gone wrong!

There was a booth there where you pay (100 baht each I think), they sell water for 20bt too. 

It’s a short but challenging walk, in all about a mile to the top waterfall. They get progressively bigger as you go up. The walk is not suitable for people with mobility issues as there’s a degree of scrambling up some quite steep jungle tracks with roots etc.

The walk to the top is rewarded with a spectacular sight and the chance to refresh in the waters at the base of the largest fall. 

I took the chance to wash my tee shirt in the fresh water and let it cool me off as I descended the path back to the bike. 

A perfect activity to fill a couple of hours!

3806,"Just back from a family trip to this national park with three kids (8, 9 and 11 years old). As a birding and wildlife enthusiast this was a GREAT EXPERIENCE. Also for the kids. Many animals seen, especially the beautiful dusky langurs and white-handed gibbons. Also we were lucky and saw one sunbear and one gaur and a couple of malayan purcupines. And a plethora of birds and butterflies.

Stayed two nights camping at Ban Krang Campsite where we rented tents and gear. LOVELY and HELPFUL STAFF and hearty food at the small restaurant (closes late afternoon so stock up on instant noodles or get a rice dish ""to-go"" and keep it for dinner). When we went to bed in the evening there would be thousands of fireflies in the dark giving everything a magic touch, and in the morning we woke up listening to the song of the gibbons. What's not to like? One afternoon we saw a very peaceful little sunbear on the fringes of the campsite behind the kitchen, and at night porcupines could be seen when we spotlighted with a strong torch. Campsite itself also quite good for birding. We hired a GREAT GUIDE at the campsite one day and he was very knowledgeable and good at spotting birds and wildlife. Camping in nature is of course always a bit basic and uncomfy, but it is a fantastic way to experience the wilderness if you are a bit adventurous and prepared to go roughing it a little bit.

Also stayed two nights outside the park at the Baan Maka Nature Lodge which was also very good - to our family this gave the perfect mix so we could explore the park over several days without rouging it too much (and we saw a leopard cat ((Prionailurus bengalensis) when walking the nature trail at the lodge premises after dinner one evening).

We booked a car/driver and a birdwatching guide for two days for our tours into the park through TONTAN TRAVEL. That worked EXCELLENT. Very knowledgeable and hard-working guide striving to find interesting birds, reptiles and mammals for us. They took us all the way up to Phanoen Thung Campsite one day and the other day we primarily spent at the lower sections between the two campsites and between the park entry gate and the first camp-site. Tontan travel also helped is book transfers from Bangkok and futher south after our stay in the park and that also worked very smoothly.

This national park is great. Not many tourists when we were there and a good wilderness vibe. Most of it is dense jungle, so very difficult to spot mammals apart from the daytime-active squirrels and langurs/gibbons, and only very limited possibilities to do spotlighting after dark (only on campsite grounds hence have to sleep overnight at the campsites inside the park at least for part of the stay if spotlighting is of interest). Only one road leads into the park so you end up walking/driving quite a bit back and forth this route when optimizing chances for spotting birds and other wildlife. 

If you are a little bit serious about seeing birds and wildlife and experiencing a fascinating ecosystem I would highly recommend this park.",positive,positive

It was also covered in 1982 with a golden mosaic imported from Italy. The inspiration for the statue was Somdet To - the most famous Buddhist monk in Thailand during the Kingdom of Rattanakosin, who died in 1871 at the foot of the statue, which was still being built at that time.

When visiting the temple complex, you can also see shrines and monuments of other deities or historical figures, such as Guan Yin, the goddess of mercy, or kings Naresuan, Taksin and Rama V. The Holy Well also plays an important role for the followers of Buddhism and the people of Bangkok. Inside the Ordination Hall there are beautiful murals depicting everyday life in Siam.

1075,"I am indebted to William Hartz & Duncan Bradford for posting details about this Wat that my wife & I visited last week.  We linked this Wat with Wat Samran plus enjoyed our lunch at Chomthungpa ครัวบ้านทุ่ง&ชมทุ่งป่ะเดอะคาเฟ่ restaurant.  A great day out in Thung Khao Luang.  

As you arrive with dinosaurs at the entrance and drive towards the large parking area you might be misled in thinking that it would be another Disneyland like attraction but it is actually an educational facility mainly structured for children, but adults could learn a thing or two.   My wife and I have endeavoured to pass comment on several photos and hope that we are right.  

The Wat suggests that all these statues emanate from Thai spiritualism, mythology or folklore giving the visitor a glimpse, as you may be there for only 2-3 hours, of the teachings of Buddha and the better way to lead your life.  I understand that construction started in 1969 and that the monk passed away not so long ago.   He lies in state within the main temple as can be seen in one of the photos.

A return visit will be made as although we walked the grounds we could spend a lot more time understanding the relevance of the statues.",positive,positive

1779,"This temple dates from the late nineteenth century, a time when the British had major timber concessions in the Phrae area and sometimes brought in Burmese workers. This Burmese-style wat,  with its multi-tiered roof and yellow fretwork, is a product of that period of history. The main hall was closed during our visit but we wandered around the grounds and had a look at what amounts to a kind of sculpture garden. It was all of rather minor interest.",negative,neutral

Although sign boards claim they are not sedated, they appear to be too tame to have not been given anything other than some sort of calming drug.

5841,"An excellent little museum about labour in Thailand from feudal times and slavery through the times of labour for wages with the arrival of Chinese coolies up to modern attempts to improve the condition of labourers and the lethal assaults on Thai workers and students by the Thai military such as in 1976 & 1992. Excellent historical exhibits touching on sensitive aspects of Thai history such as the Thai alliance with Japan in World War II and the death of so many labourers on the Thai-Burma railway. Outstanding exhibits on Thai cultural history.

The museum itself may seem old and low tech but then it relates to older, low tech times so that’s okay.

It’s at an obscure location beside the railway tracks near Makkasan Station – more than a 1 km walk from either Phetchaburi Station on MRT or Phayathai Station on BTS. There is an office in the back where the curators may be working and the reception desk may be unattended. There is a bell beside the door to ring to attract attention. Admission is free; there is a voluntary donation box by the reception desk.

There are wonderful sights to behold in Thailand where, as elsewhere, we can learn of the good works of monarchs and the ruling elite but don’t find so much about the labourers who were supporting their efforts – this museum addresses the stories of some of those labourers.

The information in this museum is not easily found elsewhere and I rate this as a 5/5 attraction. There is information here about those sensitive periods in Thai history when news was suppressed and Thai people asked what was happening. Fascinating!",positive,positive

For one, it was practically empty when we went, so we got to enjoy walking around without a huge crowd.

When we got there, the fee for foreigners was much more expensive than for Thai's. You have to hike up a trail to get to the waterfall and when we got there - it was not much of a sight due to recent rains. Muddy water.

Stairs are not that hard to get up and the view is really nice. Buddha has been under restoration the time we have visited it and it is view worthy, if it is your first temple. 

For us, it has been one of many, so there was no special markup for us. If you got time, it is still quite nice to visit it.

Then we did the khao daeng boat trip, sam roi headquarter museum and bueng bua marsh and tower in that order.    All this is covered in a single ticket inside the national park.  The khao daeng boat trip may be skipabble though it did not take much of our time.  ",positive,positive
4031,"The tour of the waterfalls in this area (see my other reviews for the other two waterfalls) was one of our higlhights of our time in Chiangmai. The fact that this activity is free (apart from getting there) and is not rammed with tourists makes it an idyllic place to relax and enjoy a more 'natural' Thailand.
To get there we caught a Grab to the Zoo, which was only around 80baht from the Holiday Inn Chiangmai (15 min journey), and walked. We went out of the entrance to the zoo, turned left, and then there is a small cut through down a small but paved road which has a sign, though it's quite faded.
I believe we were there during a drier time so the waterfall was easily accessible with a lot of bare rock and only a relatively small stream of water down the centre. Per the title, it was not busy at all with maybe 10 other people there. We also walked upstream and climbed part of the waterfall for some photos!
After this we carried on to Wang Bua Ban waterfall which can be accessed via a small path and a steep climb. I would reccomend good footwear as there is a fair bit of walking over some tricky terrain in places.",positive,positive

Yes there are cabinets with lots of different types of snakes but there is also a floor of modern well set up exhibits, explaining evolution, anatomy, reproduction etc. There is also a room with what to do if you are bitten by a venomous snake. The information on the effects of the body are very accurate and up to date with the impact of coagulopathy and endothelial disturbance.
The highlight is the 20minute live venom extraction demonstration in a specially built auditorium. The snakes used were a lot more frisky than I anticipated and I was amazed the handlers are not bitten.",positive,positive

Wat Hua Weang Tai is located right in the commercial center of Nan.  In fact it is relatively near to the 'morning market' of the city.  Due to the limited parking spaces available at the market, I parked one block away and right next to the temple.  The active morning market actually started right after midnight hence the activity creased by mid morning.  After the morning market, I recommend visitor to drop by this temple.  In the morning hour, the temple is a very accommodating site after the busy market.  Combining the two will make your early morning sightseeing completed.",positive,positive

This well-maintained place contains an outstanding 57 metre tall Laotian style square-shaped white & gold pagoda that enshrines Buddha's relic (chest). The original pagoda is believed to be built between the 7th - 9th century and is considered to be one of the oldest pagoda in the northeastern region of Thailand. However, the entire pagoda collapsed after several days of heavy rainstorm in August 1975. Thus, the Thai public subsequently made considerable donations to rebuild the pagoda (which took four years to complete) to its original splendor, as we see today. There are several more structures on the temple complex, including an ordination hall and a number of Buddha statues.

The pagoda looked stunning in the night. We felt delight while we were walking 3 times in clockwise direction around the pagoda to pay respect.

The imposing statue of Phor Than Klai or Luang Phor Klai, sits facing the highway. One would easily mistaken the grand statue for Luang Phor Thuad, another (much famous) Thai monk. 

It was unfortunately raining when we made a brief stop-over. There were two beautiful temple building flanking the statue/building 

The smaller building was worth a quick visit, It houses a few life-size wax statues of holy monks and religious figures. I respectfully prayed to Luang Phor Thuad who life-like statue sits at the central altar. Another pleasant surprise was a statue of Thay-choo-kong which is an extremely rare sight in a Thai Wat, To the Chinese, he is the guardian of earth (area).    

Overall, Wat Manee Sri Mahathat is a beautiful Thai Wat worth a stop.  

There are many Wats if you chose to drive in Thailand. All wat is unique in its own way and worth a quick 15-30min stop-over. There also a micro chance you meet with the Wat's chief monk. Do ask for blessings. I never fail to do so.",positive,positive

5090,So where to begin....Got it. This is my experience on the Sunday Night Market that closes to entire street. First getting there is a breeze by the BTS it is right there. This is a fun place to spend a couple hours at night to fill your belly with some food or just people watch. What I did notice is that some of the stuff here is slightly more expensive but not that bad based off of American standards. I didn’t go down to any or the bars so I don’t know about that. I just stuck on the Main Street. Lots of food and knockoff items to check out. And definitely a place to stop by if your on vacation and in the area. ,positive,neutral

Today it's best known for its multi-storeyed golden chedi finished in 1992.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, the temple hasn't been well maintained.  Although it wasn't locked when we visited, it's very dusty, discouraging us from continuing to the upper floors.

There was such an amazing variety of fish that I caught that day. Types of fish that I’ve never seen before. Most of the time Danny had three poles going for me so there was always action throughout the three hours of fishing. He allowed me to fish however, I felt comfortable with. If I wanted to set the hook, or if I wanted him to set the hook and just reeled in, he was fine with that. He also offered snacks and drinks during our time.

3837,"This was a unique and fun experience unlike any other I’ve had in Thailand. The hike is a grind but was fairly easy (I’m an experienced backcountry hiker). It took my wife and I 4 hours to get to the campsite (I think I could have done it in 3 hours if hiking solo). The first 7km involved a 1200m ascent and the last 3km was flat. 

We rented a tent (3 person sized), sleeping pads, sleeping bags, pillows and a blanket. We hiked up on a Thursday so the campsite was fairly slow. We were the only people in our section which was nice. It got considerably busier on Friday. 

Make no mistake; this is glamping. There are restaurants, coffee shops, gift shops, flushing toilets and showers at the campsite. You can even charge your phone at many of the restaurants (there is full cell service). 

The second day we rented bikes and explored the plateau. The waterfalls were all closed off due to wild elephants. We were fortunate to see a wild elephant, a true highlight of the trip. 

The hike down took 3 hours. We hiked down on a Saturday so there was a steady stream of people hiking up. If I do this again I would time it to avoid Friday-Sunday.

Part temple, part theme park, part zoo - all weird! The 'zoo' element is weak to say the least, unless you consider chickens and rabbits as an attraction. There was just the one visible croc, no idea if there were others hiding.

The main statues were in an area currently undergoing some serious work so access was a bit wobbly and photographs had to be raised up a touch, but that aside they are beautiful monuments. 

And then there's the Kung Fu Panda statues, and the Happy Feet ones and the massive gongs to have a whack at...

1954,"Wat Muang is a couple of hours' drive north of Bangkok and well worth the trip if you're interested in the quirkiness of Thai culture. It has two man attractions:
(1) the biggest Buddha image in Thailand, standing at 90 metres including its platform and dominating the surrounding pancake-flat countryside, and
(2) the life-size dioramas in its grounds. There is a whole set of these, most make up a ""hell garden"" where the punishments inflicted on sinners in the afterlife and graphically displayed (some may be put off by this, Thais seem less squeamish about gore than Westerners ) while others represent scenes from mythology and Thai history.  Notices explain what is going on in each enclosure, in Thai only, but Google Translate helped make things clearer.
You can make a day trip of it from Bangkok (taxi and driver for the day, cost us about 3,000 baht) and take in something else on the way. For that I recommend Wat Niwet. It's at Bang Pa-In but not taken in by the usual tours there as it's outside the palace grounds and reached by crossing the river on a cable car.

3620,"Superior to Ayutaya, Sukhothai etc, but so challanging to get to and then around.  Was here at a unique time as the country reopens but with a definite sense that even during more normal times this place doesn't get the visitor numbers it could. 

With so little tourist infrastructure nearby it would appear mostly reliant on people arriving by way of their own transport - Not an option for all. Day tripping from Sukhothai (if that is even an option as didn't see much sign of it) risks having ones time at this place rushed.  Best done by foot or bike, yiur barely scratching the surface if only using the tram. The steep hill /steps are well worth traversing to see the sites up top.  

 The point is this place deserves a visit, deserves to be done properly and as such deserves far, far more from the local and national Tourism Authorities (Inc paths cleared to each of the ruins, the descriptions of each of which are often uninteresting  offering no story about the community which built it) 

The place would lose charm if flooded by tourists but still more could be done that could aid preservation efforts, share more of Thailands history and bring greater benefit to the local population. The place rightly ought to have 5 stars but gets 4 because of where its not reaching its potential in these areas. ",positive,positive

Absolutely not on the tourist route and a bit out of the way, as far as tourists are concerned this is Unseen Thailand! Car parking for thousands of cars…why;  simply because so many Thai people come here. 
Honesty and integrity is somewhat missing in today’s world but everybody wants to achieve it and this man “PhanThai Norasing” did more than that: he paid his life for it! If you read the history he was described as a coxswain but basically he was in charge of teaching the Thai people how to navigate and captain the boats within Thailand. After he made a mistake of damaging the Kings figure head he was excused the normal sentence of death, he begged the King not to excuse him as others would use him as an example to do things wrong so the King did digress and he was executed. Beheaded at the actual spot he choose because he loved the view; he was given certain rights and the King respected him so much he had a shrine built and areas marked to the exact position where Phan Thai Norasing sat in his last moments before being beheaded and the figure head placed beside him. The full story is written on a plaque at his shrine, only written in Thai it was translated to me and my attitude changed immediately to this location, a very beautiful area and lots to see including the boat he damaged which I paced at 24 paces. Food, shops and all you need at this location. Well worth making time to visit this place of integrity and beauty. I suggest starting at the plaque and having it translated so you understand the full intent of this shrine. It is located thought the entrance and turn left past the shrine and follow your nose.",positive,positive

1992,"Even amongst the tourists who make it to Phitsanulok (a rather neglected destination), the great majority will miss Chula Mani temple. This is probably because of its location, a few kilometres from the centre of town. Nonetheless, for history buffs, it is one of the city’s most rewarding destinations. This is possibly the best place to get a sense of the city’s ancient past.

Apparently, this part of town was the original centre of Phitsanulok during the Khmer era (often referred to in Thailand as the ‘Lopburi’ period). At that time, old Phitsanulok was just a small riverside settlement and this was its primary temple. Today, a number of intriguing vestiges can still be found here and the whole site is well-maintained.

The man sight is a beautiful laterite temple ruin, with a high base and beautiful stucco on the walls. Do not miss the exceptionally fine friezes of stucco swans. This graceful building is the centrepiece. However, you should also see the Buddha footprint in the brick mandapa and the treasured Buddha image in the main hall. The building is modern but the image dates back centuries.

You will be rewarded with some stunning rock formations and it goes on much further than you first think. You’ll also see hundreds of bats and likely some other wildlife (careful if you’re not a fan of spiders!)

A torch is advised - there is lighting but it’s quite dim and a torch will let you see more of the cave. Also, don’t be fooled in to thinking it’s nice and cool. Whilst of course you’re out of the sun, it gets progressively more humid as you venture further in ( uncomfortably so towards the end) so take plenty of water.",positive,positive

It is certainly a peaceful place. I went there with my mom. I recommend that if you're going to visit there you should go from somewhere weekdays except Friday. Or else there would be so many people. 

People who loves Buddhism and relaxing should know that Wat King Kaew is a place where you can do just that. Although I really enjoy watching and seeing the animals, I have to point out that the actual part of the temple leaves something to be desired. If you like farm animals and religious forms of relaxing then this place is somewhere you should visit. Near the temple there is all different stores for example 7-eleven. Or just standard stores that is all around Thailand. Another interesting part of the temple is an enormous statue of Buddha. 

When I went we had to go ask people nearby where to buy the flowers or the incense. The farm animals were pigs, cows, dogs, cat and many other animals that I didn't see. There was this little farm place where all the animals are grouped in. Going to this temple was a new experience for me.",positive,positive

3518,"Arriving there with the motorbike, its far out of the village, a guard opened the gate and pointed out we can go to the visitors centre. But there was no-one there. So we didn't had to pay the 100 baht per person. 
We walked around a bit and saw some information that was badly translated to English by Google Translate. After 10 minutes we saw a sign behind the visitors centre saying ""nature trail""... well, lets get climbing!
It goes up very fast, but the environment is nice. A lot of trees. Here and there are some signa that are hard to read and sometimes the path cannot be found because of leaves. There are signs (wooden plank with a yellow arrow) but they are hard to see.
We saw trees, mushrooms, termites, trees, ants, leaves, trees and moss.
We didn't found the last arrow so we followed a small stream and we followed it stream downwards. Finally we came back to the visitors centre, but not where you are suppossed to get.
We also saw pictures of great views over mountains, but we did not find it.",positive,positive

3576,"This was a good 45 minutes up a mountain from the old city; maybe more. The road was being repaved in a very unorthodox, unorganized Thai style that made travel more difficult and a little dangerous. As we neared the top, past the popular template, the road got more narrow and took on the look of a woods road only still asphalt. The view was incredible from this height and a little unnerving with a primitive attempt to keep your vehicle from plunging off a cliff in the form of a semi guard rail. We saw no other vehicles as we approached the summit. As we reached the top we came across a large clearing jammed with primitive housing structures on the perimeter of tourist shacks selling souvenirs. There is a concrete path that winds its way up the mountain as it passes through stall after stall of souvenirs. Most of the stall workers don’t speak to you. Some say hello. Many young women played with their phones, not even looking up. About half way up there is a museum of tribal artifacts to view for 10 baht. The museum is actually a small enclosure the size of a one car garage. Exit through the back and you’re outside in front of a beautiful, massive, hillside garden of flowers and herbs. The concrete path continues through the garden up and up until you are very high above the village with a great view of the garden below. A little higher up and you enter a cafe with cold and hot drinks and coffee beans for purchase. There are also bathrooms if needed. Behind the Cafe is a thick jungle with exceptionally tall bamboo trees that make for great photos. Then you make your way back down the concrete path which brings you back into the gift stalls. If you’re physically able to maneuver through the stalls on the concrete path which is constantly going up and the footing can be a little tricky, then I recommend this outing for an original experience.",positive,positive

4128,"Took a day trip with a guide around the island, spent most of the time traveling in the sidecar. We were taken first to the Ban Thung Tuek ancient city site which was the highlight of the tour. Clearly the island was a major stop off point for traders coming from India and the Middle East and on to China and the Far East. Unfortunately the info centre has suffered from lack of tourists and is in a sad state with the ceilings fallen down. The excavated sites are in good shape so worth a visit if you can find it. After a very bumpy ride across country on farm tracks a short stop at a pond to see water lilies which are rare and only found here and one other island locally in the world.
On the rest of the tour round the island we saw water buffaloes 🐃, a beautiful beach 🏖  a ferry port and shrimp farm at the north of the island. Lunch at  Sunee restaurant was great, Tom Yum Goong with huge Prawns from the Shrimp Farm and a couple of beers delicious.

3875,"Although I have visited Chaam several times, I had no idea this forest park was here. What a great place to spend the morning. Easy motorbike ride from town. The park at the base of the mountain is pretty and is worth a stroll around on the paved pathway. If you're up to a short climb, you can take the stairs to the left and hike to a beautiful view point. Continue around the pathway, and you find the path leading up the mountain. This is a bit tougher of a hike, with steep climbs and some sharp rocks to navigate. There are two main view points high up on the mountain. Between the first and second view points is where you find the toughest footing, with the sharpest rocks. The second view point offers a stunning view of the rice fields, and farther off to the sea. Continue around the loop and you end up back at the starting point. 

Most of the trail is shaded, but it's still pretty hot up there. I drank over 2 liters of water. 

Many people mention the sharp rocks and the need for hiking shoes, but I walked the trail wearing hiking socks (see photo). I also could have hiked in flip flops, although I am an experienced flip flop hiker with strong feet. 

Here's a tip - although the natural way up the mountain from the paved pathway is to follow the first trail you come to, if you continue around the paved pathway you will come to what would normally be the exit point off the mountain. If you use this path to ascend, you will reach the second view point in just 350 meters, and there are no sharp rocks to walk across. It's a pretty steep climb though!

There is a coffee stand near the parking area, but it was not open when I visited.

I came on a Sunday morning. I recommend coming early. When I arrived there were just three motorbikes and no cars in the parking area. When I returned there were dozens of motorbikes and cars, plus a tour bus.

Otherwise my opinion is extremely negative, the street smells bad, in some areas it even makes you want to vomit, rubbish everywhere, dogs mostly badly treated walk down the street hoping to get food or affection from a tourist, an almost unbearable sound at night coming from the bars. The street itself is narrow for the amount of people passing by, I noticed that many tourists walk down the street barefoot, then find it strange to contract mycoses and other infections.

The pictures are separated by the Sinthao line, a flash-shape pattern which is widely found during Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin periods except in Isan (northeastern) region.

Later, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn, the army used it as its base for suppressing the Ang Yi Rebellion, which consisted of illegal Chinese opium dealers who plundered many areas of the city. 

In front of the fort wall is a public park where you can get a scenic view of the Bang Pakong River.

Constructed of bricks and cement, the fort wall stretches from the east to the west with a width of about one metre, a length of about 200 metres and a height of three metres. 

I have read that five cannons of different sizes can also be found along the wall, but unfortunately during a recent trip to Chachoengsao I was unable to see either the fortress wall or the cannon because a high green fiberglass fence has been erected along its entire length, and only the tips of top of the wall are visible.

1272,"Phra Wihan Temple has been a source of dispute between Thailand and Cambodia for many years. From Wikipedia we learn that In 1907 the Thai-Cambodian border was mapped by the French on behalf of a bilateral border commission. According to the 1904 agreement, the border would follow the natural watershed between the countries. However, the resulting map deviated by showing Preah Vihear Temple as being in Cambodia, even though it is on the Thai side of the watershed. Thailand accepted the map for official use. The Thais discovered the error when they made their own survey in the 1930s, but the International Court of Justice ruled that they had waited too long to protest and lost the temple by ""acquiescence"". 
So now you can only visit the temple from the Cambodian side. For those with strong interest in the political and historical aspects one could go in from the Thai side. Entrance is 400 baht for a foreigner. But for the politically not interested there is not much to see. You can follow a path (""up along the flower pots"") where you run into a small army settlement and barbed wire to stop you from going further. In the far distance you can see the stairs go up.
There is some kind structure depicting man and woman and a lookout post from where you can see the temple through binoculars. Finally a stone carving can be visited. All in all not really worth the visit.",neutral,positive

This temple was believed that it was built during King Narayana of Ayudthaya ( about 330 years ago), this temple became the first royal temple for Ratanakosin ( Bangkok) since it was restored by Somdej Pra Bovorn Rat Jao Mahasurasinghanat, a younger brother of King Rama I, who was during the same era promoted as 2nd king, aka, Wang Na ( a front palace). The architecture of the front palace is different from the architecture and design of royal palace art. From my personal opinion, it is difficult to say which one is better, it's just different. The Buddha statues were collected from all over the country and restored after Siam-Burma war end about 230 years ago. In the past centuries, this temple was restored by many kings and royal family. It is considered as one the important temple in the capital as a traditional Siam capital's temple.

We were unimpressed to say the least! It was filthy with sewerage outlets into the sea, causing the water to literally be a disgusting shade of brown! On speaking to an English couple who have a holiday home here,
they confirmed it’s been particularly bad over the last couple of years, due to the hotels releasing effluent straight into the sea - they do not swim here but go elsewhere .
The beach is a long sandy 8km stretch with a nature conservation at the north end. It’s such a dreadful shame that the pollutants & litter left by people who don’t care & can’t be bothered to put in a bin, spoil this area.

2291,"Hailed as one of the top 10 gardens of the world. It's huge no doubt, particularly spectacular when you view it from above. But I felt it was lacking in essence. Like as if no one knew what it should be like then just plonked a couple of huge ass unrealistic statues of random things from dinosaurs to tortoises, to otters and pigs to gnomes. Then out of nowhere is a golden shrine for the Four-Faced Buddha surrounded by empty wilderness. Oh there's also a maze in there. Strolled around randomly till it was time for the 3.30pm Cultural Show in Scala Theatre and at the end of the show, the exit leads to the partial open-air amphitheatre where the Elephant Show was on, a total of 70 mins covering both.

The Cultural Show is a showcase of Thai culture, from dancing to drums to performances for festivities prayers and rites. I particularly enjoyed the segment where they depicted a scene from wars in the past, where warriors fought on elephants. Never imagined they would bring in live elephants into an enclosed air-conditioned theatre. 

From Thai dances, it later became a showcase of dances from around the world such as Brazilian Samba to Indian to Chinese dance. Kind of odd I say. I rather they put on some display of Muay Thai instead.

The Elephant Show was more interesting. One could pay THB100 for photos with the elephants, and I'm impressed by the animal's intelligence. There were tourists tipping them, giving them cash which they took over with their trunks and then passing to their minder. Visitors can also buy bananas to feed them, which they also took over with their trunks and stuff straight into their mouths. I wonder how they differentiated what can eat and what cannot since they were just taking whatever the visitors were giving them with their trunks. 

The show was a further display of their intelligence, from shooting darts at balloons to painting (on t-shirts that were put up for sale after too), to playing football and basketball to back massages for volunteers from the audience.",positive,positive

There were no tourists, its free to get in and you just need to get the key from the monks  (huge temple on the site) and turn on the cave lights   Good footwear needed. There are two walks you can do a much longer one which goes between two mountains or the shorter one which we did.  Its around 500m long but wow lots of stairs and tricky footwork.  Some of our students struggled and a few were in tears but I loved it.  The walk we did was the path of an older river so in parts it was flat and the start is a little tricky. Its a must if you are in the areas. The walls were spectacular and just inside the entrance our guide saw a massive tarantula spider which was covered in his web with his feet sticking out.  Beware of the monkeys outside the cave I was carrying a bar of soap to the toilet to wash my hands after the cave trekking and the money run up to me and grabbed it from my hand and opened it  from the box and started eating it.

There are no signs or anything, so you have to have at least a little interest and knowledge of naval warfare to get the most out of it, but the fact that you can explore almost every space on the ship makes it really remarkable.

For those who are more adventurous and curious about Thai cuisine, this is THE place to be.  From the assistants to the instructors, everyone there is super passionate about food and thai cuisine.  Our instructors, JC and Toey, both had been chefs at a great thai restaurant.  They love what they do and you can feel that through out the classes that they want us to love thai food and they teach us to cook like a thai!

We learnt to make common dishes such as Phad Thai, Satay, and curries.  But we made pretty much everything from scratch.  We made the curry paste with a mortar.  We tasted the curry paste as we made it, so we know what flavor we are aiming for.  We had the recipes but what JC always tried hard to teach us was what the ""flavor"" should be like because that is a better way to learn the dishes.  

We also learn to make some dishes that are not common in America.  We made many salads and seafood dishes that are commonly found in Asia and in more authentic thai restaurants.  Through cooking different dishes, we learnt about Thai cooking and Thai's way of  life.  It was just wonderful.

JC is a great instructor.  She will always take the time to answer our questions.  She taught us the components and complexities of thai food.  She introduced us to all the thai ingredients and how to achieve the balance of the sweetness, saltiness and spiciness in Thai food.  Everyone at Khao takes cooking to a whole new level: Even the garnishes and plating are professionally done.  You can see from the photos.  I spend 4 days with them and I was in Thai food heaven!",positive,positive

This is actually one of the best.  Its not the biggest but has a lot going for it.
Its located right across from the beautiful Jomtien beach.  
There is a huge variety of wild foods available.  Everything from alligator to snakes, but lots of good traditional pad thai's, pizzas, burgers, etc... Something for everyone.
Lots of variety of stuff for sale, clothes, souvenirs, etc.  Good prices and you can bargain a bit.
Good music, but not too loud.  Overall, a nice, clean, safe market.  Child friendly unlike some of the seedy ones in Bangkok.",positive,positive

Visitors can get some really cool photos of the temple as background to an old ficus tree with impressive gnarled roots (an iconic shot in Sukhothai); when arriving at the temple, walk to the right outside the temple walls to reach the amazing tree.",positive,positive

One fascinating thing, however, was the history presented on the birth of the Thai alphabet. I read Thai, so I found the display where they showed the evolution of the Thai alphabet to be really awesome. 

I would normally give this place 3 stars, but I'm deducting 2 stars because of the racist pricing. You are charged more if you are white or any color that is non-Asian. 

Also, this place doesn't have air conditioning, which is a bit bothersome since, well, Thailand is hot.",negative,positive

It consists of a number of remnants of temples from about 1000 years back, and they were only recently uncovered and excavated.  From the main entrance (100 baht for foreigners, 20 for Thai) you walk to where an open bus picks you up. This takes you to the archeological excavation site, where you can see an excavated area with a well preserved skeleton and a lot of information (Thai and English). From there the bus brings you to the “Inner Town”, where you can walk around to see the Khao Klang Nai Monument, Prang Si Thep Monument and Prang Song Phi Nong Monument. All are remnants in Khmer and Hindu style, the lintels of the Khao Klang Nai Monument are quite well preserved and interesting to see. From the parking area you can visit two other monuments. You will need to organize transportation or have your own. The first is Khao Klong Nok Monument, about 3 km distance, the second Prang Ruesi Monument, another 2,5 km.

I’m very glad that I was able to make it to watch the musical “4 Pan Din” performed at The Rachadalai Theatre 🎭. All the performers did a PHENOMENAL job at performing & interpreting the story line out to the audiences to understand Thailand’s 🇹🇭 history regarding a woman who live thru the changes of 4 regions. The history/story was very touching especially the ending scene. What I also was impress by was the English Subtitle screen the theater had on each side of the stage. Over all this was a experience I would cherish forever and look forward to coming back to this theater for other shows during my next work travel and or vacation in BKK.

I am giving it three stars for what it could be, but the night we were there, most of the stalls were already closing.  It is a little confusing because there are basically three sections there.  When you get dropped off if taking a cab, all you see are food stalls and some brick and mortar stalls.  Way behind there, was a beautiful tent-city of stalls.  We got there at about 9:30 on a Thursday and already most of the stalls were closing and packing up.  Even further behind, were more brick and mortar shops with a 1950s theme.  Some beautiful old gas pumps and vintage cars were parked around.  Here are mostly antique shops, vintage clothing stores  and boutiques, which we found really high priced.

5434,"Some sources call the complex “Isaan Buddhist Park”. No Thai person seems to know that name nor have they ever heard it. I was unable to find out where this title came from. So don’t bother asking Thai people for “Isaan Buddhist Park”, just say the full name or simply “Chedi Mongkol” – and everybody knows what you mean.

Please don’t ask me for instructions on how to get there. A local friend from Roi-et drove me all the way. The location is approximately 90 kilometres North of Roi-et town. There is no village nearby. The chedi is in the middle of nowhere, so to say. I don’t think you can go there by public transport. You have to go by group tour or hire someone to drive you there. If you decide to drive by yourself, get directions from google maps first.
Surprisingly enough, there was a large Tesco Lotus in one of the villages on the way, just in case.

Shortly before arrival you pass many restaurants. They all sell the same: Grilled chicken and grilled fish, the one with the thick crust of salt – very delicious!

Upon arrival you can see that the chedi is in the hills of a jungle area. From the parking lot you can either walk five minutes or take the small tractor-train to reach the entrance. The train is free of charge and so was the entrance to the chedi. Avoid Buddhist holidays if you can. There were not many people during my visit, but I’ve been told that it can get very crowded on certain days.  

The structure is big, I mean really huge. On one sign it is said that the foundation of the building is 101 metres in diameter and the total height is 101 metres as well, referring to the name of the province you are in (Roi-et means “one hundred-one”). The garden surrounding the chedi is well maintained and the photo opportunities are seemingly endless.

When you enter the chedi, you’ll find yourself in a gigantic hall that is nearly empty. In the middle of the room are the Buddha images. This area is relatively small in comparison to the rest of the hall. The next two floors look basically the same: Huge empty space with a Buddha worship corner.

I am still puzzled over the fact that there is such a huge, well maintained place in Thailand, rivalling Bangkok’s Grand Palace in size and I never heard of it before.

A visit can be easily combined with visiting Nam Tok Soda, a waterfall not too far away. From there you can actually see Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol protruding out of the dense jungle.

Another place to add to your trip is the nearby “Tham Pha Nam Thip Non-hunting Area”, which does not have the status of a national park, but is treated like one and it is under the authority of the Thai National Park administration. It is just 10 kilometres away.",positive,positive
4691,"Went last week with my Mum for this dinner cruise. Pretty much of what was mentioned below in the other reviews are true. The boarding time can be really slow, & even though we arrived there at Asiatique The Riverfront around 1900hrs & only managed to find the check in counter at 1915hrs (Yeah, the place is really huge!), we are still able to board the vessel (Thank Goodness!), but had to wait like another 30mins queueing to do so. We booked for the Upper Deck tables (Which I would recommend), & the views are good. Took some nice memorable pictures along the cruise. Food wise I think is decent, not exactly top notch but good enough with some varieties. The staff were helpful & friendly enough, but I can tell that most of them were quite overwhelmed due to the large no. of guests. The entertain onboard was good too.  But ultimately, I think we're pretty lucky as the weather is rather kind to us on that night. I think it'll be kinda sad if we were to be met with a downpour on that night, as it'll be a real wet blanket for sure. So Best of Luck...",positive,neutral

I walked around, visited the museum which is at the entrance, also visited the Chedi and the forest itself. A junior monk was hitting a cat with a broom and had to tell him to stop. Not very inspiring and he was breaking a precept, not unusual though I imagine. Ubon is a busy city and without the monasterys to visit found no reason to be there.

You have to cross mainly ankle deep river about 20 times each way so be prepared for wet feet. There are times when you wonder briefly if you’ve missed a path or a river crossing but you soon pick it up. There are a few narrow bits and plenty of fallen trees to climb over.

When you get to the sign saying 1 hour steep diversion because the other route is unsafe please note - it is steep for a short while but it is only 20 minutes to the waterfall and there is a beautiful cascading waterfall that you can swim in at the end. It’s blinking cold mind you!

Many Hornbills,Gibbons and even an elephant were the highlights. The elephant was great luck when we were driving searching for animals in the afternoon. We had one day with Deaw and on the other day another super nice and experienced guide. They were both amazing and so knowledgeable. We also saw lots of different places in the park. As we had another day in the area Deaw was so kind to organize us a driver to see the millions of bats flying out of the bat cave at sunset.

We didn't have much time here, about 20 mins. I would recommend about an hour. Don't forget to dress respectfully. Shoulders and knees must be covered. 

It started it construction during King Rama II time. He wanted it to be a tribute to his daughter. Hence why it means Temple of the Angels. It is famous for its architecture influenced by Chinese arts.

The great Thai poet Sunthon Phu, lived here during his monkshood in the early 1840's. His biography is shown at the museum that is dedicated to him on site. 

There is lots of fun history here to see. If you are not into history the grounds are stunning and the architecture is much different them most of the other temples in Bangkok",positive,positive

1580,"The Wat Khun Inthapramun (InPramun) is a Buddhist temple which is located in Pho Thong, Ang Thong. The temple is located in a rural area (in the rice fields) about 10 Km North of Ang Thong town. On the grounds are the ruins of several ancient temple buildings & chedis. The largest reclining Buddha in Thailand is enshrined here.
 The main attraction of this sacred temple is the white reclining 50 meters long Buddha statue (Luang Phor Khao). The image was built at the Sukhothai era (7 centuries ago). The image of the reclining Buddha represents the entry of Buddha into Nirvana and the end of All reincarnations.
According to the legend, Khun Inthapramun was a royal tax collector and he used some of the tax for building a sacred object. Being discovered that, he was sentenced to death and his remains buried there. And temple was called Wat Khun Inthapramun.
We drove (about 15 km) from Wat Muang to Wat Khun Inthapramun. The navigation was somehow difficult and the navigating programs were not enough for finding the temple. So we asked the locals for the proper route, which was leading to the Wat. 
Currently the reclining Buddha is staying outdoor, it's not within the temple, since the original temple has been destroyed for a long time, Only the ruins of the pillars have remained. Around the reclining Buddha image there are some large trees and vast nice greenery. A new high-tech main hall has been built recently (for the temple) which has both elevator and escalator for the visitors. 
There's a very interesting attraction beside the Reclining Buddha, It's a vivid colorful outdoor market that sells Thai eatables and Thai, Buddhist souvenirs. The atmosphere of here is really friendly and peaceful and relatively not crowded. 
The Wat Khun Inthapramun is really a hidden gem which is located only 120 km away from Bangkok. When I was in Wat Khun Inthapramun, I noticed that there was no foreign tourist there. Go there and enjoy a local historic mysterious temple!",positive,positive
3820,"This cave is nothing special, I mean it probably would be if you took a floodlight in there so you could actually see something. The lighting inside is so dim you cannot really see much, you definitely cannot see all the individual chambers they say it has.  It takes about 20 mins to walk through the cave and back, the cost is 300 baht for non thai people, absolutely not worth the money! it was also roasting in there with little air. It was like walking around in a sauna.

 I compare this to the Wat Tham Khao Pun
cave in Kanchaniburi which was 30 baht each, it was cool and not like an oven and we saw bats and lots of cool shrines!)

This Wat is a monastery still in use by the Buddhist clergy. It is located along the west bank of the Chao Phraya River. Entry to this site was free.  There are sign boards, illustrating its history and significance. The place was not crowded. The architecture of the temple is the classical Thai style. The pagoda here is white.

1215,"This is by far the most scariest hike that I have ever done. Note that I am just an amateur hiker so the bar is pretty low but note that there were people who turned around and no longer climbed to the top. The reason is because the scariest part of the climb are the very steep metal ladders that you need to take before reaching the peak. The ladders are made up of large metal pipes which are around 4-5 inches in diameter and are inclined at about 60-70 degrees steep. Yes, almost vertical. Each step were spaced far apart that anyone with short legs will have a hard time climbing them. Also, there were no flat platform on each step, but only that thick round metal pipe. Good thing that it wasn’t raining that day, or else, if the stairs are slippery then we would’ve turned around also. And the scary part is that if you slip, then you’ll fall a considerable height, around 2 stories high. Experience may differ from person to person, but my legs were shaking when going down. Remember that by the time that you get to the stairs part, you’ll be pretty much tired already.

After conquering the hike, you’ll be rewarded with an amazing view! I know you have already seen the pictures. It’s really really good.

By the way, the place is full of monkeys and there is secure parking area which reminded me of zombie movie scenes wherein when going in, someone has to open the gate and stay guard so that no monkey comes close then you have to close the gate quickly again afterwards. The keeper uses a broom to scare them off. There’s a donation box which we just put money as there was no more attendant when we left. Please be careful with your stuff, donlt bring plastic bags as the monkeys will think that it’s food and try to take it from you.

I don’t think that there were public transportation to this place. We had a car that we rode from Bangkok to here. There are minivans that go from Bangkok to  Kampaeng Phet which also passes through Nakhon Sawan but this place is very far from any town center.",neutral,positive

Theres a nature trail that visits 4 waterfalls but theres not much water at this time so dont expect spectacular views. Look for the big blue plastic water hose running up the side of the stream to see how much water could be coming down!
The walkways start gently sloping then some steps then some rope strung between trees to hang onto while you scramble up muddy slopes or roots from trees or up rocky sections. Very steep in places and flip flops definitely NOT recommended.
Halfway up you can divert up to the view point which is good although west facing so very hazy in the afternoon. Expect to shed gallons going up here but there is someone selling water at 20 baht per litre at the top!
Recommend cutting back to the second waterfall rather than heading right for the top as those coming down said theres not much water to see.

Climb the stairs or ride the escalator?

The temple is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the city of Chiang Mai and situated at an elevation of 1,073 meters.

4240,"This place is currently only known to Thai tourists, and has been steadily gaining attention on social media over the last year since it opened. It is apparently an enterprising venture between several villages to create an attraction to bring tourism into the area, so you have a market built on a long bamboo corridor on the water's edge, where one side is filled with lotuses, which no doubt would look spectacular if in bloom. Various bamboo constructions were made, including a 4 story tower which gives a view of the surrounding area, and boat rides can be hired to travel a little way down the river. 

It's pretty much set up to enable people to take a lot of selfies and is very instagrammable, if that's your thing. The market itself is rather sparse, and is more akin to a village market rather than the glitzy polished versions found in the capital. Being new, the place can be difficult to locate and get to without a smartphone, as signage is rare.

The museum is across from the main parking area and the main temple ‘bot’. It has three sets of stairs ascending to the entrance, but not much signage to direct you there.

The 2 highest points in Thailand (Doi Inthanon and Doi Phahompok) are only big hills. There are roads going to the top. This is not the case with Doi Chiang Dao, it's true mountain there. 

It explains why it's difficult to go there and why it's less busy. This is the reason as well why it used to be the favorite place of real trekking lovers. Unfortunately these last years it has been more and more complicated to explore the moutains there. The National Park has limited the entry to 4 months in the year then has closed the entry to the summit. It is now impossible to go to the highest point and inside the wildlife sanctuary.

It's a shame because it's a stunning area. Hopefully there are other trails around that few people and only one agency knows. I recommend to go there with them if you really want to discover Chiang Dao.",positive,positive

What a beautiful temple on the hilltop between Roi Et and Mukdahan in NE Thailand. Not so close to Roi Et, closer to Mukdahan really, It is in Roi Et province but right on the border.
4 levels and a serpentine staircase up into the dome. The 360 Outside view is wonderful but inside is spectacular.  It is the combination of central region and northeastern region art style;  white with golden decoration. This is the first time I have seen stained glass or a likeness of it in a Thai temple. It is decorated with 60kg of gold and announces that it contains Buddha relics.  Surrounded by gardens, fountains, walls and even enclosed by a fortified wall on the perimeter of the grounds. A rather special temple and worth the trip if you are within 100 or 200 kilometres. 

And it's free to enter, even for farangs. There is even a courtesy golf buggy style bus for the 300-meter walk up the gentle slope. We walked up entrance 2 and there are many balancing rock piles built by visitors.

1142,"Wat Phai Lom, located on the banks of the Chao Phraya River in Pathum Thani, is (in)famous for what it destroyed rather than what it is!  For decades, the trees around Wat Phai Lom were the winter nesting sanctuary for hundreds, if not thousands, of Asian open-billed storks.  The scene was truly fantastic and the cool-season nesting site attracted thousands of human visitors to see the fabulous sight of the graceful migratory birds.  The stork chicks and fledglings were especially endearing to observe!

For years, the human visitors spent considerable amounts of money on snacks and drinks and obviously contributed generously to the temple during their pilgrimages to the stork sanctuary.  In a stupendously idiotic tragedy, however, the temple abbot and decision makers went on a huge construction binge, knocking down trees, piling up construction materials, making loud disturbing noises, and otherwise making the area unattractive to the nesting storks. To make a long story short, they managed to ""kill the storks that laid the golden eggs.""  The storks got fed up with the disruptions to their mating and nesting and abruptly stopped returning to the temple grounds about five years ago (various reports are that the storks are now nesting in Buriram, Nakon Sawong, Nakon Chaisi, and elsewhere).

The temple grounds are now blighted by a huge temple building dedicated to the storks that no longer visit (unmaintained, falling apart, and home to a large number of pigeons), a crumbling giant sculpture of stork, and a large empty parking lot. Almost no visitors go to the temple nowadays. Unfortunately, there is really nothing for tourists to see here anymore except for evidence of human folly and disrespect for nature.",negative,positive

Carpark is free, and toilet is available there. 
Then, you will pay for the a 4WD car for 500THB to go to the hydrangae field. If you come with big group, then it is value for money. As we only have 2 people, we are lucky to share with another group and the cost is spilt. The drive by the local on 4WD takes about 15 min, road is muddy,steepy and narrow hence normal car is not able to enter. You will pass by local farms along the way.

After second and third time, I give no star to them. After I checked some 1 star comments here, I totally agree to them. Anybody who would have common sense will do the same.

“This is a place could be amazing, but unfortunately there are full of staffs who want to make their own rules. They successfully created a non fun environment. “

“very slow and inefficient at the cashier. Prepare yourself at least half an hour to buy the ticket.”

“Nice place but they are sneaky.  They play the same annoying song over and over until it drives customers crazy and makes you want to leave.”

——From other comments.

If you have a simple request like my kid wants to play this one (buffet)and that one with parents, the staffs play”don’t understand game” or they really don’t understand ( in this case they have no idea what they doing)

Also 3 times I came here, I had been told different policy for same games. ( basically they want you to buy more tickets but with very inefficient way, wasting MY time only because they don’t even have customer at that time.)
I don’t mind paying more money, but as a business, 3 times different rules? Are they made by individual staffs by that minute? Depends on the staff’s mood?

Some staffs were not happy, some of them are sad and miserable, I cant imagine these people would care for kids. One of them almost slammed the door with my kid’s figure there.

Buying tickets are difficult takes long time. They really build up a messy system. Last 2 times I came here I felt like run away from the cashier(downstairs only, upstairs were fine) they are very difficult to communicate while I feel like they are not going to help with anything even they understand( most them speaks zero English).

Anyways, if not because the place has things kids wants to play, I will always avoid it. Then I learnt dont ask, no staff use their brains here.",negative,negative

A surfaced road runs right to the cave entrace but one must park earlier, weekends are very busy when there are many vendors - I doubt that Western food is avilable. It is not advised to bring pets as there is a tribe of monkeys close by that are quite tame. There is no public transport in the area and the site is very rural; best approached from Nong Samet (on route 331) use 3340 via Bo Thong and route 5002 - or from Klaeng (on route 3) use route 3430, pass Khao Chamao National Park and onto route 5002 - both these take about an hour. There are other cave temples nearby.",positive,positive

3856,I spent a month in the province exploring every nook and cranny of the the two valleys. This area is really nice because its a different climate. You will find the Siam tulips growing on both sides of the main building and maybe find a nice soi dog as a guide for your walk on the trail. The view point gives you a good idea of how many different crops are growing and what season the harvest was in. If you time it right you will get a perfect fog bowl. I tried twice never got a full picture of it.,positive,positive
3632,"Wintour are the only bus company to operate between Sukhothai and Chiangmai.  One cannot book direct with the company online but through a third party.  This made me uncomfortable as I could not be sure that the tickets would be honoured and there was no way to contact Wintour for conformation.  Also there is no indication of where the Wintour bus will stop in Old Sukhothai for the onward journey to Chiang Mai.  The bus stop is at the end of the old town opposite a tiny wat  and the Abandon Koff Cafe.  It is on the side of the road that is going to New Sukhothai.  Passengers are led across the road by a staff member holding a red flag to stop traffic!  You must exchange your paper ticket from the third party for a confirmed ticket from the Old Sukhothai office (preferably done at least the day before).  You will be asked to find your name on the seats indicated on the computer screen.  If it is not there, the lady will ring the office at the New Sukhothai bus station and your seat will then be confirmed and you will be given new tickets.  There are some seats and a toilet (western style but no toilet paper) at the office.

The buses to Chiang Mai leave at 9.50am (9.30 from New Sukhothai) and 10.50 from Old Sukhothai.  Prior to ascending the steep stairs to the upper level you are given a drink, cake and bottle of water.  If you have booked early enough (bookings open 30 days before departure) you may be lucky to get the front seats which have ample leg room but your view through the dirty windows may be partly obscured by an old non functioning tv screen.  The buses are certainly not new or VIP.  The seats are reasonably comfortable.  Our bus did stop a number of times to let passengers on or off at unscheduled places and although it did stop at a bus station, we have no idea of which one as there was no sign and the bus did not stop for more than a couple of minutes (driver toilet stop).  We did not use the on board toilet down stairs as going up and down the steep stairs would have been hazardous on a moving vehicle.

The seating is two x two.  The bus stops at Terminal two in Chiang Mai and you will need to go to Terminal Three (across the road) if you are purchasing Green bus tickets or any other tickets.   The bus is met by crowds of tuck tuk drivers and hotel touts.  Get a Grab or Bolt if you are not comfortable negotiating a fair price for your travel to your accommodation.  

If you are well heeled then it would be better to hire a private car and driver for the journey rather than using Wintour.",neutral,positive

691,"I would like to write a review of THE PASEO PARK (Kanchanaphisek). 

THE PASEO PARK is located on the Kanchanaphisek road between Petchkasem road and Boromarajonani road near the Association Southerner. There have the label show the stores in front of the park. I think it looks strange and unconventional.
The symbol of this place is the red Torii door. It looks like the door of heaven in Japanese believe. There have a lot of restaurant especially the Japanese restaurant.The middle of walkway has the small stream and Japanese bridges. 
I think the bridges look so cute and there have the restaurant that we rarely seen.
I often go to this place because it nears to my home and easies to go.

Overall, I think this place is very beautiful. It likes I am walking in Japan.
The decorations are very beautiful, good design, good to take photos, have a lot of restaurant. But I think there have less parking. Sometimes there have a lot car but no people so I think maybe because the parking are free so they took their car to park here and go to the others place.If we go in the afternoon, it will be very hot because it is the outdoors mall but there have the Plaza part.In Friday-Sunday, there will have the market inside the park and there have a lot of things to look and buy. I really like it.

For me, I really like this place. It likes my second home because I really often go to the Paseo park and I want to invite everybody to come here and I believe that you will like this place like I am.",positive,neutral

Both sections are interesting, but I would certainly not claim that Kamphaeng Phet is anyway near as impressive as Sukhothai, so if you have to choose one or the other, go for Sukhothai.  At the section slightly further away from the town center, you can drive your car from one ruin to the next, but in the section closer to the city, you must park and walk inside the park. One beautiful feature of the section close to the city is that the ruins are lighted from sunset until 8:00 pm.

5901,"Wat Prasat is located on Intawaroot Rd across rom Wat Phra Singh, within the old city walls and was probably built at the end of the 16th cenutry. The temple complex has two chedis (pagodas). The ubosot, viharn and one chedi are constructed in a straight line.

The Lanna style viharn
The classic Lanna style viharn that was built in 1823 is a wooden structure, set on a stone base. It has a steep three tiered roof with chofah (a royal symbol representing the protector garuda) decorating the top ends. The panels on the entrance as well as the pillars are intricately decorated with carved flower motifs in Lanna style.

The stairs leading to the entrance of the viharn contain large Nagas (mythological snakes) guarding the building.A unique feature of this temple is the short tunnel that connects the viharn to the chedi behind it. Usually the viharns principal Buddha image is found towards the back of the wall opposite the entrance.

At the Wat Prasat the center of the back wall contains an ornately decorated entrance to a short tunnel that leads to the chedi directly behind it. The sitting Buddha image that can partly be seen from the viharn is actually inside the chedi.

On either side of the tunnel entrance a number of Buddha images are seated on pedestals about 1 meter high. One of the images is a bronze dating back to 1590, the others are stucco and of a more recent date. Part of the viharns walls are decorated with murals from the early 19th century.",positive,positive

It was peaceful inside the compound. We spent about 30 minutes here to look around and capture some pictures. Since the temple is a bit out of the way, it can be difficult to find a ride for the return trip, so it would be advisable to book a round trip and have the driver wait.

There are many interesting things about this market, such as traders divided into several areas, some sell in kiosks on the mainland and some sell on boats on the Toei river. Sellers who sell on boats have a unique way of delivering their wares to buyers. They use a piece of bamboo or wood to deliver the customer's order which has been put in a plastic bag.

A simple journey of barely ten miles brings you out to this water attraction where it is possible to drive right round the perimeter of the lake.
Its main draw though is for locals who come here in their hundreds to relax and eat a meal in scores of little thatched huts on the lakeside.
Food is available for tourists to buy and do the same thing, but I was there purely for sightseeing and there was a lot of that to do.
Apart from a walk by the lake it was also possible to go boating on it for a few baht.
Perhaps the most striking attraction here are the amazing rice straw figures created on open area.

The ferries run on a very regular basis from before dawn well into the evening.  On getting to the other side, pass through the ferry terminals to the roadway out the front and turn right: it is about 500m to the Chedi.

I interacted with a man named Ajin/Phra Billy, who promised that I can come and stay and ordain as a monk. Only to learn from another monk that that it was completely not true and the ritual was for something else entirely. Initially he was cold and dismissive when I visited but as soon as I donated to the temple and him he became very warm...

When I found out I was basically scammed, I left immediately; The abbot there was irresponsible and didn't even meet me after I ask to meet with him to talk about the problem. He was quite friendly though when I initially donated 2000 bhat to the temple just to speak to him. I spent 7000 bhat in traveling cost, 9 hours of travel from Chiang Mai, and around 3 days memorizing Pali for a total experience of nothing except that I now know monks at this Wat are unscrupulous liars who only want your money.

336,"""MORE STUFF""? YEAH, I ALREADY HAVE THE ORIGINAL ""STUFF"" ON TRIPADVISOR'S KO MU ANG THONG PAGE (there are 2 for some reason - the one with more reviews).

KO MAE KOH is the island in ANG THONG NATIONAL PARK with the GREEN LAGOON/LAKE made famous by the novel “THE BEACH.” Admittedly they later shot the movie way across at PHI PHI LEY in the ANDAMAN SEA – largely because the beach there fitted more closely the description in the novel: KO MAE KO’s main beach although nice is small.
Note however KO MAE KOH is not ANG THONG’s main island – that is the headquarters island KO WUA TALAP. This has the even better known climbs to THE HIGH VIEWPOINT and LOTUS CAVE. The good thing is that most daytrip  itineraries make a point of calling in at both islands – if not, pick another trip provider - the 2 main islands are dead set highlights. (in my research, one outfit out of KO PHANGAN substitutes a SNORKELING STOP for one of the 2 main islands. Shallow water and closeness to some big mainland rivers means water clarity isn’t great for coral or snorkeling). 
Most visitors to the island come in on one of the daytrip boats out of KOS SAMUI or PHANGAN ((last I heard you can’t get daytrips from KO TAO or the MAINLAND but there are some charters and an occasional sailing cruise from the former). 
Because there are other spots in the marine park to visit, each MAE KO stay over tends to last 90 to 120minutes. This gives plenty of time to climb to the GREEN LAGOON/LAKE viewpoint and laze on the beach afterwards.

THE CLIMB – when I first visited in the ‘90s there was a rough somewhat circuitous and longer climb to the lagoon. This has been replaced by a much shorter wooden stairway leaving from the corner of the beach – it’s in very  good  condition suggesting it is only a few years old. This is one steep climb – I reckon a lot is abt 45degrees. Fortunately the climb is short (a sign said 150m but I reckon that was the height of the platform – the actual length was more like 300m which is still pretty short) and there are plenty of resting platforms on the way up so even unfit people should make it with a few stops. The view at top is a 2 way panorama of THE LAGOON in one direction and surrounding islands in the other:  well worth the effort.
On the way down, something new from my 90s visit – a branch in the stairway leads down to a platform not far above the lagoon’s green surface (colour comes from the limestone). Swimming is forbidden in the lagoon.

THE BEACH – once the climb is done, visitors spend some time on the beach. This is very compact – only about 60m long but has plenty of sand even at full tide. There is a pretty big swimming enclosure which keeps swimmers away from longtail boats shuttling people from the floating blue plastic pier near the foot of the stairway to the daytrip boats offshore.
I grabbed a dive mask and checked the underwater scene in the deeper part of the enclosure – not great: ANG THONG’s close to some big mainland rivers and in the shallow Gulf so water clarity isn’t fantastic. Coral likes clarity. But I’m an elitist- non-fanatical snorkelers won’t find the underwater scene boring. 
There must have been 20 daytrip boats (evenly split between largish slowboats and speedboats) offshore and the small beach got pretty crowded. A national park canteen behind the sand was doing good business. There is an amenities block nearby. 
There were also a lot of kayaks drawn up on the beach – many slowboats  carry kayaks, and passengers have an option of paddling from a nearby island across to MAE KOH. However unlike the beach at NATIONAL PARK HQ ISLAND (KO WUA TALAP), I don’t think NP hires kayaks here.

First of all, ones have to hire 4WD pickup truck (together with a driver guide) which cost 500 baht  and can hold passengers upto maximum of 10 (It should be noted that vehicles other than 4WD pickup truck are not allowed in this activity). Although it is legal to drive your own 4WD pickup truck, you are still recommended to hire a car and a driver because the path is cut through the dense forest and is very narrow so that 2 cars cannot use this path simultaneously, therefore all chauffeurs have to use walkie-talkie to communicate with others.

As our car climbed up the mountain (07:45 am), we (in the back of pickup truck) felt the cool fresh air with gentle breeze. After 20 minutes of penetrating through the rainforest, we reached our first stop on a huge rock at the edge of the cliff which provides panorama view of the forest below. Then, we walked to the highlight ""3 whale rocks"", 3 purple huge rocks protrude from the cliff resemble 3 whales (view from above and imagine) of different sizes ( 2 bigger rocks called ""father"" and ""mother"", while the inaccessible smaller one called ""baby""). This point also provides a panorama view of greenish forest below. 

The next stop is ""elephant rock"". Without using any imagination , it is undoubtedly an elephant! The driver then took us to ""Phu Sing gate"", 2 standing huge rocks at the edge of the cliff forming ""little gorge"" that looks like a big gate to the thick jungle (and fabulous view) below. After that, we drove to ""Phu Sing wall"", a natural vertical rock wall with beautiful pattern. Finally, our last checkpoint was a quirky place called ""Sang Roi Bor"", bumpy landscape contain hundred of holes at the edge of the cliff. Of course, you can see a panorama view of abundant forest at this point.
 
Besides the stunning views, our chauffeur was very nice and provided us some interesting historical facts about this place. Around late 70's to early 80's, the forest was used to be communists' hideout (as underground organization). Some comrades passed away here and their bodies were buried somewhere in the forest. This is why the alternate name of the forest is ""pink jungle"" (bit lighter than ""red"").

This amazing place is ""the must"" for ones travelling to Bueng Kan. Don't miss this ! Highly recommended.

5646,"The view and place were beautiful! I went to Viewpoint 1 and 2 and appreciated both despite the very sweaty hike up lol. I was very glad I wore my running shoes instead of slippers! It gets quite steep (still very safe) in some areas. When going downhill, make sure your shoes have grip as the slope can get slippery if wet. There are handrails there if you need. 

There is a 50bht entry fee at Viewpoint 1's entrance. The funds go towards maintaining the viewpoint/s. It was also worth it with the thought and presentation that went into the decoration at VP1 specifically. VP2 was also nice and clean. 

The reason for the 4-stars (based on my experience) is because I found it to be overcrowded at VP2 at the time that I went which was around sunset. While I understand that sunset is THE ideal time to go, it would have been nice if the others weren't so loud and smoked so much weed that it made the whole place smell so pungent. Though, I do understand that I may have just been unlucky at the time. 

Nevertheless, the viewpoint itself is definitely a 5-star. There is a cafe at VP2 for you to order drinks from. The views are amazing, you can see the 2 sides of the island and generally the beautiful Koh Phi Phi landscape. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.",positive,positive

2498,"The Khao Mai Kaew cave was an interesting and challenging trip for me personally. To get there, we had to go through the jungle/forest, climbing a couple of sets of roughly made ladders. I am about 1.55m (on a good day) and some of the rungs of the ladder were quite widely spaced that I had to stretch pretty high up. We had to pull ourselves up with ropes on a few other occasions. 

We had a ten minutes break from the hike up before we entered the cave. The interior of the cave itself was superb. Some parts were slippery, others were just small openings we had to squeeze through. It was a tough climb up to the cave and a challenging one inside, so honestly, I was not fully able to enjoy the wonders of the cave.

It was an overall a superb experience. What I don't recommend is for small children (in age or stature), or anyone with respiratory issues (cos once you are deeper into the cave, breathing can be difficult.), or those whose stamina is not up to par (like moi) to participate in this activity. But, I'll do it again in a heartbeat since I know what to expect now.",positive,positive

There are buses from Bangkok, take one of the ones that go to the Laos border.  Lots of cheap resorts in the area to stay at, and you can find monkeys about 5 km away, but you'll need help from a local to find them.

1654,"I've come here for a 10 day course twice, 6 years apart, and it has been profoundly healing and beneficial. Some reviewers have mentioned construction noise, and it's true that in the last 6-7 years a huge undertaking to renovate this 500 year old monastery has been underway. But it's all mostly done now, and there are so many perfect spots to meditate that if you find somewhere a bit noisey there are many other options, including an underground air conditioned room. ""Hearing, hearing, hearing.""

Personally I found the food excellent and struggled to not overeat (too much food = sluggish mind).

The instructors, especially Meichi Saree, are helpful and deeply compassionate. Phra Ajahn Suphan, the abbot and head teacher, has been at the monastery since he was 15 (35+ years ago) and is a kind and patient teacher.

I will say that if you're looking for a place that is extremely strict and serious, this is not it. They tell you not to talk and put signs up, but people do and nobody stops them. If you want to have a fruitful practice, refuse the urge to socialize at all, or even to make eye contact! It seems pleasant, but just gives the mind something to latch onto. I have heard that if you're looking for a more rigorous and intense practice, you can study with Phra Ajahn Suphan's teacher at Wat Phradat Sri Chomtong, but you should probably have at least one 10 day under your belt first.",positive,positive

There aren't too many visitors like in Wat Phra Doi Suthep. There are statues of pigs around the place since it is a place of pilgrimage for people born in the year of the Pig. 

It is basically a small place. Monks and devotees were bowing & praying at the golden stupas. I walked around the golden stupas clockwise 7 times to offer prayers for world peace.",positive,positive

3491,"Our visit to Thailand's Maeklong Railway Market, also known as the Train Market, was an unforgettable adventure. Located in Samut Songkhram province, this market is unique because it's set directly on active railway tracks. Vendors line the tracks, selling everything from fresh produce to souvenirs, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The real excitement begins when a train approaches. We had the unique perspective of witnessing this from inside the train, boarding at Ban Kalong. As we neared the market, vendors quickly retracted their awnings and moved their goods just inches away from the tracks. The market transformed into a narrow pathway, with the train passing slowly and closely through it. After the train passed, everything returned to normal within minutes, showcasing a seamless blend of daily market life with this extraordinary event.

Beyond the thrill of the train, the market is a sensory feast. We explored the stalls, sampling fresh fruits, seafood, and delicious street food. The friendly vendors added to the charm, making our experience both thrilling and flavorful. Visiting the Train Market was a highlight of our trip to Thailand, perfectly blending tradition with excitement. Whether you’re a thrill-seeker or a foodie, this market is a must-see, offering a unique and memorable glimpse into Thai culture.",positive,positive

However, the main drawcard here is an 11th century black stone statue from the Haripunchai kingdom. It goes by various names but it is perhaps best known as Phra Sila Dam, the Black Stone Buddha. It is now enshrined in the vihaan in front of a huge seated Buddha. The statue is now completely covered in gold leaf, so do not expect to see a black stone statue.

Wat Chang Lom has a bell-shaped chedi which is supported by elephants. An inspiring frieze depicting 36 celestial elephants, runs around its square base. These figures represent the elephants which carry the world on their backs. The atmosphere of the temple is very calm, peaceful & interesting. It's located just beside the Bike Route. You can access the temple very easily via ""Sukhothai Bike Route"" by a rental bike. Riding through ""Sukhothai Bike Route"" before 9 a.m. is the best gift in Sukhothai old city.

I took the MRT to Bang Phai station,  Exit 1, and then down the stairs or with the elevator, it takes about 15 minutes to reach the pedestrian bridge over the canal, and then to the grounds of the temple. There is the Meili Café near to the bridge, good espresso and brownies. 
There is so much to see at this temple, of course the giant Buddha statue is the main object for pictures. From the pagoda which is behind the Buddha pictures of the area can be taken. In the pagoda there are several levels to climb up the stairs, definitely worthwhile to do. 
Several foreign women walked around with very tight shorts and bustier, unfortunately the Thais are too shy to tell them that wearing such dress is very disrespectful.",positive,positive

Inside the project you can get a basic meal very cheaply - for more choice try the market outside the gates. This market has a good variety of fruit and vegetables too.

The Cave is set half way up a mountain so there are more than 600 steps to climb to reach it and if you want to see the view point at the other end of the cave be prepared to climb another couple of hundred steps. Having said that the views are worth the effort. The huge cave itself is impressive to say the least but last time we were there some of the lights weren't working so some care must be taken when negotiating the way through as the limestone can be slippery in places. This may have been rectified but I just wanted to give you the heads up just in case. All in all a very interesting experience and aplace I take all my visitors from overseeas to see.

2091,"Our parents live just few miles down the road so we visit this wonderful place every time we go to visit our parents. First of all, this is not the thypical shiny tourist place you'll find in tourist locations. So there are no entrance fee, anyone can come and walk/cycle/drive around freely. There are very modest fees if you want to see the show (usually twice a day) or feed an elephant. This place is where tens of individual elephant owners genuitelly live in one big community with their elephants and families. Absolute majority of them are from families with centuries of elephant keeping traditions so there are centuries of acumulated ckowledge and experience of living together and taking care of elephants. That's why this place is offen chosen be scientists for their researches. If you want to experience this place properly, I reccomend to visit it for few days, so you can whitness early morning or late evening life, feeding, bathing of elephants in big lake or taking them for long walks to the river. As this is much more natural village of elephant keepers rather that fake tourist attraction with busy schedule, best of all find someone who can accompany you showing arround more hidden gems and action as place is very big and well spread around. Bear in mind that elephants naturally are kind of shy animals afraid of unknown, and they feel confortable of strangers only if their keeper is present nearby. That's why it is advisable not to approach elephant which is left on its own, as you might scare him/her and scared animal may cause harm to himself, you or others",positive,positive

I don't believe there is anywhere else that one can experience being in the presence of former captive elephants just being elephants. At BLES, visitors spend their days out in the forest watching the elephants graze and interact with each other.  I always enjoy the delicious, vegan food served there. Lodging was provided at a quiet, comfortable homestay less than 10 minutes away. Despite the language barrier, staff is so welcoming and kind. I am truly grateful for the hours I spent in conversation with founder, Katherine, who not only runs the sanctuary but takes the time to make every visit special for visitors. In my opinion, BLES is the ONLY place to ethically support elephants in Thailand.",positive,positive
1620,"I think it's really worth the visit, in part because the local villagers have recognized the advantages of opening up their village to outsiders in a way that is very different from the usual tourist, souvenir-selling sites. They have opened up their homes as home-stays, and they have done it with charm and warmth. At the same time, right next to some of the individual houses, are open excavations of grave sites that date from the first millennium BCE. There's a small, very simple museum that has examples of some of the pottery (which to my mind is the most beautiful of all the marvellous prehistoric pottery made in Thailand). It's freely  open to everyone, including the stray dogs, so it's well worth leaving a contribution in the collecting box.",positive,positive

Around the chedi, you will find a Rattanakosin-style Thai temple with white walls and green, gold and red roofs. It is a sacred place for Thai people and the chedi remains highly venerated.

 When we came out from the farm, they have a small shed selling fruits, sunflower seeds, honey, nuts, drinks and some local products.  It was a very interesting experience.

2549,"Stunning! 🤩 

The place you see in the movies and always want to go.  Large limestone formations lush in greenery.  We hired a private long-tail boat for 5000 baht through our hotel.  The boat could be used for up to 6 people for that price.  This time it was just the two of us and well worth it.  The other boats were packed with up to 20 people where as we had so much room.  Our driver was great and even stopped at a private area just for us to swim at with no one else.  The lake is vast and an absolute must see when in Khoa Sok.

Tip:  transportation is not easy or cheap around the area.  The lake is 1 hr drive from the main area with most of the hotels at the National Park Headquarters entrance.  Arrange through the hotel.  Alternative if you have your own transport you can hire a boat directly from the pier for around 1300 baht per person.

Cons: 
If you don't speak Thai, it might be a touch tricky, as most commentary and exhibits in only in Thai 
Some of the gear is a little outdated and needs a bit of maintenance.

1188,"C’mon See… the Geological Resource Museum!  
By:Hanna Kim    

Introduction 
->Do you want to see the museum that tells everything about rocks? If you do, you made a good choice reading this review! This museum talks about minerals and rocks, but it even teaches about the earth. And this museum even sells a collection of rocks and minerals. If you are learning about minerals and rocks at your school for science, you made a great choice! C’mon, what are you waiting for? Read along, see what it has!
 

Of Course, Lot of Teaching! 
->This amazing museum has a lot a teaching. You see, down, up, left, right, it all has millions of teaching. It even teaches you how rocks are made. This is one fact that I learned from there. Every rock in the world is always from a volcano. Every fact has an little picture explaining. This fact has an picture with a cycle. It teaches at first how the rock was made, how it gets soft, and how it gets hard. Now you will think how could a rock could be soft? But it is true. Before it gets hard, the rock will be soft. It gets hard because all of the rain, wind, and the sun! Before I didn’t go to the museum, I didn’t know even a tiny bit of rocks and museum. But now, I know way more than my 14 years old big sister. Now you know Geological Recourse Museum’s first reason to go. But there is two more reasons to go, so don’t be tired reading now!    

Some Kind of Special! 
->Geological Recourse Museum has some kind of special! It means it has a special event. Are you sad I said event, not events? If you hear what I say you will be happy than sad. Are you ready to listen? All righty then, really? Okay, it has a place where you can find a fossil with a brush. Like there is a place where’s sand over the sand. Get it? And one more thing is there is no people but they could go any moment. So if you go faster, the better. Are you very excited now that you are begging your parents now? You would be never sad if you try the event. Trust me, it’s true!	

Best Place Ever!	
->Now you heard my two reasons but remember there is one more reason left! I told you there was a museum that had lot of teaching and some kind of special. But there is one more to hear! Next to the Geological Recourse Museum, there is a shop where you can buy rocks and minerals. I told you there was somewhere where you could buy mineral and rock collections but this is a different place! But sometimes the shop closed. But you could still go  next to the shop and look what there is! Even though the shop is closed, there is a place where there is rocks and minerals lying on the floor. And the best part is that it’s... FREE!!! I didn’t buy the rocks on the shop but sometimes it better if you do. You have to make a good choice. It’s your choice!

Conclusion:   
->Now you heard my three reasons are you going to run out of your house? If you like this review, you’re going to like my other ones, too. I hope you enjoy your trip! Remember, the faster you go, the better!",positive,positive
3751,"Phimai was an important town when the Khmer Empire ruled over much of Thailand, so it’s no wonder the temples here bear some resemblance to Angkor Wat and some think Phimai to be a prototype for the famous monument. In fact, when you finally walk into the inner courtyard, it does feel like you’re looking at Angkor Wat, and I’ve been there!

Phimai is a triple walled buddhist sanctuary that was regularly maintained and repaired, for which we have to be thankful. The outer courts are largely in ruin and there is not much to see. The bridge linking the outer and inner courts are in very good condition. The first set of steps of the bridge is guarded by lions, while the second tier is the more traditional Buddhist Naga bridge. The bridge links the human and heavenly realms of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology,

The entrance to the main temple is decorated with images of dancing Shiva. The entrance leads into a long narrow passage with architraves decorated with reliefs of scenes from Ramayana.Further in, the reliefs turn to Buddhist scenes. The main altar has an image of Buddha being sheltered by Naga. The mandapa above the Buddha has a high ceiling. It’s mainly on the exterior where there’s a lot of decoration, most prominently several giant reliefs of Garuda.

Phimai Historical Park is a fantastic day trip from Korat, especially if you like archaeology.",positive,positive

A religious woman had a vision from Buddha to build this shrine dedicated to the feminine. She went back to Bangkok and raised the funds and now it is used by Chinese Buddhists for their main festivals,
It's quite beautiful in the mountainous setting and has the classic Chinese Buddhist style. Quiet and serene it's a fine space for contemplation and reverence. Seems no religion can keep the Great Mother done although some of tried,.",positive,positive

1817,"In our way from Ao nang to Phang Nga we found ""Wat Tham Ta Pan"" monastery. Wat Tham Ta Pan  is one of the most weird temples in Thailand. It's Located in Phang Nga (100 km from Phuket). It is a kind of Buddhist heaven and hell temple which showing what happens to bad and good people with many colorful statues. 
At the entrance you’ll see a fountain with five monks with bowl statues. The temple has a vast yard with many Buddhist elements and statues and buildings and an interesting spot for photography. There are peaceful scenes designed to represent heaven, and the sin park is a small sculpture garden full of figures from Buddhist hell (Naraka). The most stunning thing in this temple is a steep staircase which leads to a small roofed temple with panoramic viewpoint at top. The scenery is really breathtaking and all surrounding area is visible. This monastery is worthy of visiting.",positive,positive
2187,This is really one of the most beautiful Buddhas in Thailand. If you’re in P’lok then you have to see.  In Feb there is a festival for the temple.  There is also an in door market that sells a lot of local goods as well as tourist stuff.,positive,positive
5542,"Wat Songtham Worawihan is worth a visit because unlike the many ""Thai"" Buddhist temples in this area, it owes its existence to the Mon.

The Mon are an ethnic group from Myanmar and were responsible for the spread of Theravada Buddhism in Siam, Khmer, Annam and other parts of what is today called Indochina after they were converted by Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka.

Many Mon refugees fled to Siam in the late 18th century to escape persecution in their homeland, Burma, and were accepted and integrated into Siamese culture.

Many of the architectural features of this temple are distinctly Mon, including  three chedi and ceiling murals in Mon style.",positive,positive

1322,The old town of Lampang is quite small so the weekend market or walking street as it’s referred as is actually very nice 👍.  It takes a good 30-45 minutes to walk and longer if you frequently stop at the stalls for shopping for trinkets or clothes.  Has plenty of food and snack stalls also lined with many types of restaurants.  I believe it goes from 5pm to 9pm so get there early.  People are friendly and it’s not boisterous with bars.  Nice for everyone up for a stroll near the river. Great for family and kids too.,positive,positive
1513,"A very interesting story behind this Chedi, indeed a brave and courageous lady.
During Ayutthaya period, Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) reigned the kingdom and had Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai as his wife. The Burmese army surrounded Ayutthaya by using the invasion route via the Three Pagodas Pass from Kanchanaburi to the west, and then to the capital Ayutthaya. The King  mounted his war elephant in preparation for battle. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai (the Queen) was so worried that she dressed in military attire and followed them on a war elephant. When the Ayutthaya army had faced the vanguard of the Burmese army , Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) engaged the enemy  but the elephant charged away from the enemy. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai, therefore, charged ahead between the King and the Viceroy to block his pursuit and was fatally injured. Whenever the Burmese saw that it was a lady killed in battle they stopped.
One of the very few chedi’s to evade damage from the earthquake so stands immaculately beside the chao phraya river. The area beside is a beautiful garden.Do check out the museum on the opposite side to the garden but unfortunately there is only Thai script but nice to look at anyway.",positive,positive

4471,"A particularly charmless and empty area on a blistering hot Wednesday late morning.  Few tourists, and some aggressive vendors.  We suspect the atmosphere might be much different (and more lively) at night.  But like other similar areas around the world, we foreigners are seen as walking ATM machines.

It is impossible not to notice that cannabis shops dominate the street by a wide margin.  Anticipating the Government's intention to ban these for general use, several have changed signs to say ""medical"".  But it is also hard not to wonder what can replace them if they close.  There are soooo many.

Advice:  just don't even think of going there in the morning.  And public bus 2 or 511 snake their way through the city and are a cheap way to get in and out.",negative,positive

2937,"This was such an amazing treat. If you can, visit the mountain in the morning. I hired an English speaking guide who had a van. I would not attempt this trip any other way. The mountain is especially steep, and in the daytime, hard to know if someone is in the curve. You need a rugged vehicle in good condition. Scary part aside, lots to love. There are Chinese vendors with snacks and an eating area. I grabbed some tea, and waited for the sun to rise. I’m from Connecticut. I’m know stranger to cold. I had on my down jacket. It was freezing. Bring gloves. I threw on some extra sweat points on top of my leggings. I also was wearing a long sleeve turtle neck. There is a camp site. Would be great to rent a tent and camp out to watch the sun rise. Even during CoVid, a good mix of visitors. After watching the sunrise, I went to do some site seeing. I returned in the afternoon to hike the mountain. I don’t think I could have done it in the dark. It is steep. If you have any fear of heights, I would not recommend this. I was shaken, though I’ve skydived, bungee jumped and parasailed. There is no railing, and the path is narrow. As you climb the mountain you’ll see a variety of trails to the summit. I picked one that had a lot of bush and turned around.  The other path seemed like I was walking on the edge of the mountain, and without any guards however, it was the correct way. It was a bit slippery, I had running shoes and would recommend solid hiking gear, since I slid a bit. On my way down, i practically crawled to keep my bearings. I had my tripod and camera, and packed them away to focus. I’m 167 centimeters. Scary stuff aside. This was such a worthwhile hike. It was also beautiful. Enjoy and be safe!",positive,positive
4458,"I’ve been associated with Thailand in both legitimate employment contracts and leisure visits for 50: years and have never had an issue until 18 June 2024 when my wallet was pickpocketed around Sukhumvit Soi 4. I’m told the pickpocketing is now rampant along this tourist strip and believe me when I say those involved are extremely proficient at the game - I was totally oblivious that I’d been done and being a professional Traveller and in 50 years of international living and traveling this experience was only the second time I’ve been done, the first was 20 years ago on London south bank and those middle Europeans were very very good but believe me the Thais have caught up.
Take care and watch every move you make.",negative,positive
5522,"Both the Wat and the Market are located 2 minutes walk from the Riverfront Hotel (turn left). The Buddha is big and photographs do not catch its size.  This is also a car park and place for street stalls. Try a cup of coffee made in a sock. This is a French legacy from over the river - dark roasted and served with condensed milk. Next door is the covered IndoChina Market. The French name Indochine is transcribed into Thai and the market is called 'Dtalat Indochina.' It is similar to many such markets in Thailand, Cambodia and Lao but it is not aimed at tourists, so you will find local produce. It closes at 6 pm.  The rest of the town is in bed by 10 pm.  There is a sort of promenade on the other side of the road beside the river. It faces due east, so sundowners are backlit. A few foreigners may take beer bottles to the prom and watch the last of the light across the great river Mekong. The night is dark on the other side. Early to bed and rise in these parts of the world.",neutral,positive
3758,This is one of my favorite places. Even here is not the big place but it is quite adventure place. The staff will queue up for tourists to get inside 30-40 pax per round to prevent getting lost inside. Tourists can follow the LED light to exit. This cave is not so suit to big size people because it is quite narrow where you cannot stand up straight to walk. You have to bow your body all the time and slide to pass some part. There is no tour guide charge but you can give them tip as per your consideration.,positive,positive
2370,"We went for 8 am, there were already boat loads of tourists. 

Swimming into the cave was really neat (80 meters to the beach), the beach inside is small and not much to it. 

At that time in the morning the colour of water (emerald) was not very visible. The clarity/visibility below for snorkelling was very poor. 

You saw more of the emerald coloured water when leaving the cave.",negative,positive
3164,"""Guilin of Thailand"", these words don't do justice to the breathtaking beauty of this place.  The lake is actually a man-made reservoir in the middle of dramatic limestone mountains.  You can access at the reservoir dam which is an hour's drive from Surat Thani city.  There are a number of tour operators there, offering from short 2-3 hour boat rides to overnight stays in one of the floating resorts on the lake.  We took a short boat tour by Chieolan Holiday, their desk is near the pier opposite the ticket area.  The owner's son was our guide and boatman, and really good at taking photos too!   When we started the boat ride it was drizzling and a bit misty, which added to the atmosphere.   Our stops included the สามเกลือ (""3 buddies"") rock formation and a short stop at a floating resort and fish farm.  Once the boat engine stops, the silence in this huge lake with towering mountains around is very peaceful.",positive,positive

4697,Phra Pok Klao Bridge has a combined  bike lane / walking trail that goes over the Chao Praya River. Free from motor vehicle traffic its quite a clever idea. I chose to go there for a walk being bike less at the time.  The bike lane is interspaced with plants and benches where you can sit and watch the river traffic go by.  Its also accessible by wheelchair. There being a lift at either end. I was there in the middle of the day and the river views were fab. There's a ferry terminal (N6 Pier Memorial Bridge) nearby so its quite easy to access. Just a short boat ride  from Saphan Taksin Pier.  Underneath  the bridge is Phra Pok Klao Park through which you can access the skywalk. I meant to go back during the evening because its a lot cooler and the views were said to be better. Everything being lit up at night. (It was a bit hot during the day even with an umbrella)  There are public toilets in the park below the bridge. They were fairly basic. At the time I visited there was a layer of black mud (not all dry) throughout the building. I gathered it was from the recent floods and hadnt been cleared yet. All in all a good walk with some pleasant views.,positive,positive

5831,"We are huge aviation enthusiast and this was a definite stop in our BKK 5 days. Its great as others have said to go direct by BTS and then its a 5 min walk all signposted. The inside is air conditioned and there are a number of aircraft that are outside with no shelter so bring an umbrella and fan as its was hot in the sun. The little cafe on site is available for cold drinks too . When we arrived the gentleman at reception gave us an in-depth explanation to the history of the museum and when he found out my son is an RAF cadet then he talked a lot about how the pilots are trained and what the museum means to the TAF.

On the ay back we didn't have to pay for the BTS tickets , not sure if it was just luck or a perk of going to the museum , wither way we spent 2 hours there and really enjoyed it . Do visit and donate , whilst it is free to enter , they really do a great job.",positive,positive

1235,"We stayed in the Sukhimvit section of city and took a taxi to Hualamphong station to catch a 8:30 train with a/c for about 700 baht for the 2 of us. The ride was about 1.5 hours and comfortable. Then hired a tuk tuk driver at the station to drive us from site to site for 3 hours for 800 baht. The distance between sites is not walkable so this is a very good option. This is a world heritage site not to be missed while in Thailand. Easy to get there and do at your own being steered to tourist traps. On the way back, we chose the mini-van for 70 baht each. The driver was fine but Bangkok traffic is deplorable.",positive,positive

3467,"This is Lampang's hidden gem. It's one of the most beautiful places in Lampang. It's a ways out of the city, but if you rent a motorbike or take the train, it's one of the MOST AMAZING rides of your life. The views along the rode are like nothing you'll ever seen. The Northern Thailand landscapes are unparalleled.

I've heard some people complain about the price - it's really not bad cmon! Yes, locals have a lower price - but that reflects the salary ratio of what local Thais make. 

20 baht for locals (75 cents in US) vs. 200 baht for foreigners (around 6 USD). Like seriously?? Are you really going to complain about 6 dollars? the average monthly salary for an avg worker in Lampang is around 15,000 baht (500 dollars) so yeah, they are going to have a cheaper price. I know this because I lived in Lampang. Don't complain! 

THE thing to do in Chae Son is to boil eggs in the hot springs. It's an ""only in Thailand"" experience. Something about the temperature or the minerals makes the eggs boil from the inside out. So if you boil for 15 minutes, you will get an egg that has a soft-boiled yolk and a gelatinous (but cooked) egg white. It slides right out of the shell. Eat with soy sauce. Best egg you'll ever taste. 

There are also many hikes to waterfalls and such in Chae Son. There are free places to swim in the hot springs too and you will often see local kids splashing around. It is truly a local hidden gem.",positive,positive
5402,"We have just returned from a visit to Chulachomklao fort after first reading about it on Richard Barrow's website. Our accommodation is on the Khlong San side of Taksin bridge and we arranged a 'grab hire' where we had the use of car and driver within greater Bangkok for 4 hours at a cost of 1200 Baht. It took 45 mins to get there and 1hr 15 mins to get back so we had two hours at the fort. An hour of this was spent exploring the Mae Khlong ship - access all areas and it was fascinating, then there are the gun placements, Rama V statue, military hardware exhibition and Mangrove walkway compete with monkeys, which we skilfully avoided.

On top of all this you can see out to the Gulf of Thailand and watch shipping entering the Chao Phraya river. There was a large seafront restaurant which was reasonably busy considering it was a weekday, we only had time to buy drinks and ice creams though.

You may disagree, but this is my idea of a great day trip from Bangkok and the Grab option just gave us peace of mind that our transport was sorted so we didn't have to worry how we were going to get back to the city. 

Entrance to the fort with all its attractions is free.

We took passports with us as entry is through a checkpoint  but we were not asked for them, perhaps as we arrived with a Thai national who was driving the car. I did spot one other western visitor who was wearing some kind of pass so perhaps if you arrive by tuk tuk or taxi, you may need to provide ID.

Overall, well worth a visit and thanks to Richard Barrow for the recommendation. ",positive,positive

The lower floor contains a nice gift shop and interactive displays and textile pattern stamps from the various regions in Thailand.

The walk down to the ashes of the monk as well as the Buddha antechamber is also nice but what is most striking is the large gong (rakang) at the entrance.
