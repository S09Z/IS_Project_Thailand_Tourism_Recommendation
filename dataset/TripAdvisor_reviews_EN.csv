Tucked away amidst the humming cityscape is a temple that quietly beckons with a unique call to generosity ‚Äì the act of coffin donation. 

This temple, a serene oasis, has become my unlikely pilgrimage site. Here, away from the skyscrapers' shadows, I participate in a tradition that honors life by supporting the journey after it. The coffin donation is a profound gesture in Thai culture, an offering of dignity and respect to those who have passed away without the means for a proper farewell.

Each trip, I find my way to the temple gates, where the metropolitan bustle gives way to a tranquil courtyard. The sign pointing to the 'Coffin donation' reaffirms my purpose. Inside, I'm greeted by walls lined with names, each representing a soul whose departure from this world was eased through the kindness of strangers. 

My contributions here are small, humble threads in the larger tapestry of communal care that this foundation weaves so diligently. But the impact, I've come to realize, is immeasurable. In Bangkok, among the temples and tuk-tuks, I've found a place where I can leave a piece of my heart, contributing to a cycle of giving that reverberates with the enduring spirit of humanity. 

This tradition has become an anchor of my Bangkok experiences, a meaningful counterpoint to the ephemeral joys of travel. It reminds me that amidst the transitory nature of life, there are enduring acts of kindness that define our existence.

That said, the place is astonishing in many aspects and visitors interested in learning more about the temple and Dhammakaya meditation are warmly welcomed.  We tried to call in advance for information, but no one answered the phone, despite repeated calls... strange.

At the left as one enters the main compound, there is an information station that will register visitors and arrange for tours (which reportedly can also be booked in advance online).  A transport will then be arranged to take visitors to a welcome center, where an introduction to the temple is provided.  Visitors on tours are required to be dressed entirely in white, and if necessary are provided white pull-over pants and shirt at no charge.  Free tours of differing lengths can be provided, with English tours of 90, 120 or 180 minutes available.  The day we went, we were the only ones on the tour at the time we were there.

A golf-cart type vehicle took us around the massive compound (more than 300 hectares, with some 150 buildings) to see many of the structures and we were given some of the history of the Dhammakaya story.  The temple is reputed to be the largest in the world. The main feature of the compound is the Maha Dhammakaya Cetiya -- the huge UFO-like dome-shaped stupa, adorned with 300,000 small, gold-colored Buddha statues placed on the outside of the structure and another 700,000 inside (we were not taken inside the stupa).  

Surrounding the cetiya is the ""Meditation Square"" -- an open paved plaza that can reportedly accommodate 400,000 people.  Further surrounding the square is the Grand Meditation Stadium,"" which is a massive austere two-level structure a kilometer on each side, that can seat 600,000 people.  At 5:30 p.m. each evening, there is a ""lighting ceremony"" after which the main cetiya is brilliantly lighted, giving it a glowing golden appearance.  Well worth seeing.

The Dhammakaya movement is shrouded in controversy, which is beyond the scope of this review.  Suffice it to say, the controversies result in some evident underlying tensions that exist in the form of tight security in some areas of the compound and subtle defensiveness of staff when discussing some topics.  The penchant of the movement for strict discipline has led some to make comparisons to Nazism, a point that is brought further to focus when people are bizarrely informed that the main cetiya and other structures in the compound have been ""built to last at least 1,000 years"" (echoes of claims of the durability of the Third Reich?). 

We were not unduly pressured to give donations although donation boxes were conspicuous in many places throughout the compound and we were informed that merit is constantly running out (akin to water flowing out from a leaky pail) and needs to be constantly replenished (presumably, most readily through generous donations).  Quite dubiously, we were given a plain envelope at the end of our tour and urged to put a donation in the envelope that would then reportedly be given to the temple ""in the name of the international centre staff"".  Seemed particularly odd.  

Throughout our tour, our photos were taken at several locations (we were given the opportunity to deny their use in the temple's social media at the start of the tour) and the tour guides repeatedly said that copies of the photos would be emailed to us.  Unfortunately, more than two weeks after our visit, and after several reminders, we still have not received the photos.

If you don't want to join one of the tours, it's also possible to enter the compound with your own car or taxi and proceed to the Maha Dhammakaya Cetiya and the Meditation Square.  Many visitors, in fact, go there everyday in the evening and walk around the cetiya (one round takes about 15 minutes).  Visitors on their own are encouraged to wear white, but are not required to do so and many do not.

Overall, this is a very interesting place, steeped in mystery and intrigue, as well as highly impressive from architectural, religious, and meditative perspectives.  Obviously, anyone interested in learning more about the Dhammakaya method of meditation will find it particularly relevant to visit.","A mix of amazing, soothing, mystifying, confusing...",NONE,2022-08-31,4,Wat Phra Dhammakaya,Bangkok,P03025435

209,8,8078161,en,751694875,"I had done a lot of research before going to this temple to get a blessed sak yant tattoo by one of the monks, expecially by Luang Pi Nunn.  I had previously gotten a sak yant tattoo by an ajarn in Chiang Mai.  My friends and I hired a taxi driver from our hotel for 1000 bahts roundtrip from Bangkok.  We left Bangkok at 7:00 am and arrived about an hour later.  Upon arriving, our driver asked someone at the temple where to get the offering, which building to go, etc.  There were a couple of different tables that sold offerings, one charged 75 bahts and another one charged 60 bahts.  After that, we were led to sit on a stone bench where there were 4 women waiting before us.  Interestingly enough, one of them spoke very good English and told us that we were at the right place.  About 15 minutes later, we were led upstairs to a building.  Right away, I felt something was wrong because I read from other posts that upstairs are for foreigners to pay large sums of money to get a sak yant tattoo.  Sure enough, once we were led upstairs, we were given a menu with all the different sak yant tattoos that they offered.  We were then told that the tattoo fee started at 4500 bahts and up depending on the pattern that we choose.  Well, I knew right then and there that we were led up to the wrong room.  After asking a couple of questions, we were told that there is another building where the monk does the tattoos.  Right away, the English speaking lady who were there before us tried to convince us that where we were was a better option because there was no wait.  But that's not the reason why we went to this temple.  So, I went downstairs to the other building to investigate.  Sure enough, Luang Pi Nunn, was in the middle of giving a tattoo to someone with about 5 people waiting.  After what I saw, I immediately went back to the other building to retrieve my friends.  As we left the upstairs room, the 2 ladies (one who spoke good English) followed us downstairs.  I thought, ok, may be they are coming to the other building with us.  Well, they left and was nowhere to be found.  A few days later, I thought about the event and I realized the English speaking lady must be part of a scam at the temple to bring unsuspecting foreigners upstairs to pay for the very expensive tattoo.  

Now that story is out of the way, let me tell you the steps.  Once arrived at the temple, find the tables that sold the offerings.  Then find the right building where the monk performs the sak yant tattoos.  The room is located on the ground floor of a building.  So, if you were led up a bunch of steps, run the other way unless you want to choose your sak yant and pay an arm and a leg for it.  Once you find the right room, you need to make a 25 bahts donation on silver platter in the middle of the floor.  You will also put the offering you bought on that platter.  Then you will find a stack of pink envelopes (very worn because they are reused).  You'll then put a donation into that pink envelope, find a place to sit on the floor and wait for your turn to get tattooed by the monk.  The rest you can just watch and learn while you wait for your turn.  It is important to remember that the monk determines which sak yant and its location on your body.  There is no pictures allowed inside the building and please be respectful to the process.  The tattoos that we received were done with a tattoo gun.  Just because it wasn't done with a stick doesn't take away from the power as long as you show respect and be a good person.

I guess this is the way a monastery should be, but reality it makes a very crowded meditation center, with few private kutis, so a lot of people are squeezed in each communal kuti. Although the kutis are very convenient and each floor has its own 2 private bathroom and showers, and each one has ceiling fans, the more people squeezed in a kuti, the harder it gets to sleep and meditate. 

This place is very welcoming to foreigners and beginners, and so the atmosphere is not strict. They allow you to choose whether to keep silent or not and they allow using phones as long as it is both in silent areas. They are very soft in the discipline, which requires the meditators to be in self discipline. I would say, this works for locals, but less with foreigners who are not used to worshipping idols, minding the surrounding of the others etc. 

Foreigners have to understand that this is mainly a monastery of Thai culture, and so they require women to sit at the back in the meditation hall. This is the buddhist Thai culture, and foreigners must accept it, otherwise they will just feel frustration.

The statues were impressive and unique. Many had a similar face, a smiling face which was sometimes serene and sometimes creepy. The works of art here are mainly concerned with Buddhism and Hinduism and show an alternate depiction of the same-old statues you see everywhere else in Thailand. In fact, they even felt critical / subversive. For that reason, I was surprised people were making offerings to some like they would at a regular Wat.

The place was a bit run down. The statues -- while amazing if a bit repetitive -- could use some upkeep. Also, Thai descriptions explained what the various scenes represented, but there was nothing in English. I may have enjoyed and understood more had I a translation. Also, the facilities were pretty rough. I used a mid-park lavatory that was practically falling apart. (Maybe there were nicer ones elsewhere?)

Some sculptures represent local proverbs that teach moral principles, some illustrate significant events in local literatures, while some display Buddhist beliefs such as ""Karma"" and ""Samsara"".

284,0,6987966,en,937501675,"IMPACT Arena in Bangkok is a bit of a mixed experience. The venue itself is impressive with its large size and modern facilities. You'll notice during events that the sound quality is excellent, which is largely due to the well-thought-out interior design that helps sound engineers. Also, the air ventilation system works well, especially during crowded events, keeping things comfortable.

Seating, however, is just average. It's not exactly uncomfortable, but it can feel a bit cramped when the arena is full.

The complex has a good number of restaurants and enough restrooms. But, it falls short when it comes to an adequate waiting area outside the arena. Additionally, accessibility for guests with disabilities isn't the best, mainly because of unclear signage.

A notable downside is the transportation. The arena doesn't connect well with public transit, making it tricky to arrive and leave. Taxis are not only hard to find but often charge higher rates, and there's no organized taxi queue. The lack of nearby bus or train options means many visitors have to use private transport. However, parking is a hassle, with high fees and often heavy traffic. For big events, it might be a good idea to stay at a nearby hotel to avoid these transportation woes.

Overall, while the arena does a great job hosting events, it definitely needs to improve in terms of accessibility and transportation options.","Great Events, Tricky Transit",Family,2023-12-31,3,IMPACT Muang Thong Thani,Nonthaburi,P03018284

 I had a AWSOME experience in the province of Sing Buri. (Funny i ask my wife why every town ends in Buri ) I now no it means town / city. But I'm sure you smart people out there new that 
Anyway it was the 100 day passing of my wife's grand farther. We went to Sing Buri to a family gathering. Good and alchole. Wow wow 
Those Thai boys like there Whisky 
So it was big for them getting the Farang drunk. I held my own though I don't drink a lot. 
On the Sunday morning after a big saterday night every body got up we stayed in grandfathers home were the clay water pots around the back yard were over 200 years old as was the house it was so cool sleeping there for me. 
Scattered around the yard also were old fishing boats very old. I did see traditional fisherman floating down river in these boats but that's another post 
So food was prepared in abundance to take to the monks at temple every one help including the kids. 
The experience next was so cool   We all went to temple near the house and a gathering of monks sat on the floor we placed the food in front of them on traditional trays and silver water drinking dishes. Then they chanted for a hour I think for my western ear it was Somthing I will never forget. The harmonies wow wow wow that's all I can say 
Then they ate Wat they could. Then the children gathered the remaining food and placed it in front of every one else  I was instructed to eat. The food is considered blessed as the monks have touched it. And because they are full from eating this fullness is passed on to grandfather for a safe journey to the next life. 
I was humbled i became emotional i also was getting watched by every one as they had never had a Farang take part in a ceromony like this in that temple. I'm sure others have experienced this though. I felt so lucky. 
It was like a initiation for me into the family. 
Then back to the house for more Whisky. I was lucky my wife dragged me away from her brothers and we went and checked out some of the other Temples in Sing Buri. Such as the temple were the inside is all solid gold. I got to look inside. 
I'll shut up now and perhaps i can tell you guys about that another time. Got to get of the loo now

You can rent a bicycle or walk to go around this small island. In my opinion, it is better to walk than cycle, because the pathways are actually quite narrow. Also, you can take in the sights much better as the stalls are located next to one another. The pathway is actually the circumference around the island. That being said, only a section of the entire pathway is taken up by the food stalls, hence, the remaining parts of the pathway are actually better to be explored if you have some form of transport. There are motorbike taxis at certain points of the pathway, such as where the markets end, where you will not see any crowd beyond. The motorbike taxi can take you through for 50 THB.

It was a pleasant journey that took about an hour. You get to the island and you are left to your own devices. There was a small weekend market selling food, I just kept walking.

I did stop at a small photo studio to get my portrait one as a souvenir for 30 baht(he said it was a weekend special, usual price was 50). i happened upon a pottery factory/shop and got some beautiful tealight holders which they will safely wrap for you to bring home. i was there by lunch time but most of the riverside cafe/restaurants were filled, so i kept walking. 

You will pass little houses on stilts and nature. its a very nice village and nice to see the way of life of the people who live there. i hald walked 1/4 way in the path and was about to regret not stopping for food but I somehow found Rongsi Studio which also had Milli cafe which is housed in a 100 yr old former mill. Had my lunch there before continuing my journey. 

The whole walk is about 6km. Just do not stray off the main path if you do not have enough time.

-I was there on a Sunday (during covid times) so it wasnt as crowded as I thought it would be.
- most of the signs are in Thai, it was mostly Thai tourists. 
- there are various temples on the island,  but i did not visit any of them.

336,2,7378165,en,480411078,"""MORE STUFF""? YEAH, I ALREADY HAVE THE ORIGINAL ""STUFF"" ON TRIPADVISOR'S KO MU ANG THONG PAGE (there are 2 for some reason - the one with more reviews).

KO MAE KOH is the island in ANG THONG NATIONAL PARK with the GREEN LAGOON/LAKE made famous by the novel ‚ÄúTHE BEACH.‚Äù Admittedly they later shot the movie way across at PHI PHI LEY in the ANDAMAN SEA ‚Äì largely because the beach there fitted more closely the description in the novel: KO MAE KO‚Äôs main beach although nice is small.
Note however KO MAE KOH is not ANG THONG‚Äôs main island ‚Äì that is the headquarters island KO WUA TALAP. This has the even better known climbs to THE HIGH VIEWPOINT and LOTUS CAVE. The good thing is that most daytrip  itineraries make a point of calling in at both islands ‚Äì if not, pick another trip provider - the 2 main islands are dead set highlights. (in my research, one outfit out of KO PHANGAN substitutes a SNORKELING STOP for one of the 2 main islands. Shallow water and closeness to some big mainland rivers means water clarity isn‚Äôt great for coral or snorkeling). 
Most visitors to the island come in on one of the daytrip boats out of KOS SAMUI or PHANGAN ((last I heard you can‚Äôt get daytrips from KO TAO or the MAINLAND but there are some charters and an occasional sailing cruise from the former). 
Because there are other spots in the marine park to visit, each MAE KO stay over tends to last 90 to 120minutes. This gives plenty of time to climb to the GREEN LAGOON/LAKE viewpoint and laze on the beach afterwards.

THE CLIMB ‚Äì when I first visited in the ‚Äò90s there was a rough somewhat circuitous and longer climb to the lagoon. This has been replaced by a much shorter wooden stairway leaving from the corner of the beach ‚Äì it‚Äôs in very  good  condition suggesting it is only a few years old. This is one steep climb ‚Äì I reckon a lot is abt 45degrees. Fortunately the climb is short (a sign said 150m but I reckon that was the height of the platform ‚Äì the actual length was more like 300m which is still pretty short) and there are plenty of resting platforms on the way up so even unfit people should make it with a few stops. The view at top is a 2 way panorama of THE LAGOON in one direction and surrounding islands in the other:  well worth the effort.
On the way down, something new from my 90s visit ‚Äì a branch in the stairway leads down to a platform not far above the lagoon‚Äôs green surface (colour comes from the limestone). Swimming is forbidden in the lagoon.

THE BEACH ‚Äì once the climb is done, visitors spend some time on the beach. This is very compact ‚Äì only about 60m long but has plenty of sand even at full tide. There is a pretty big swimming enclosure which keeps swimmers away from longtail boats shuttling people from the floating blue plastic pier near the foot of the stairway to the daytrip boats offshore.
I grabbed a dive mask and checked the underwater scene in the deeper part of the enclosure ‚Äì not great: ANG THONG‚Äôs close to some big mainland rivers and in the shallow Gulf so water clarity isn‚Äôt fantastic. Coral likes clarity. But I‚Äôm an elitist- non-fanatical snorkelers won‚Äôt find the underwater scene boring. 
There must have been 20 daytrip boats (evenly split between largish slowboats and speedboats) offshore and the small beach got pretty crowded. A national park canteen behind the sand was doing good business. There is an amenities block nearby. 
There were also a lot of kayaks drawn up on the beach ‚Äì many slowboats  carry kayaks, and passengers have an option of paddling from a nearby island across to MAE KOH. However unlike the beach at NATIONAL PARK HQ ISLAND (KO WUA TALAP), I don‚Äôt think NP hires kayaks here.

Enjoy your visit ‚Äì KO MAE KO and other parts of MU KO ANG THONG NATIONAL PARK are well worth the time.",More Stuff You Might Find Useful,Solo travel,2017-03-31,4,Ko Mae Ko,Nonthaburi,P03005979

""Just came back from it. They still continue working, and changes are coming fast! On weekends busloads with Thai people come to visit: organised by villagers, bring a monk with them. Many from area Nakhon Sitamarat. Interesting to see that families donate the robe and go around the main Buddha statue after praying with one of the available monks. On this Sunday we saw every 15 minutes new groups , maybe 10 at the time, going around with the orange robes/cloth.

My guess would be 75 meter? 

There is a story that it is build for the new king Rama 10, partly donated by the father of the kings former wife.
I would like to learn more about this temple. If I find out, will tell here.  (I live nearby in Manora Garden, Phangnga.)""

The building construction was fascinating to me, using old gnarled trees as the supports and they looked amazing. The landscaping was more impressive than I‚Äôve seen at any other temple. Although it was a bit smokey the view was still impressive. 

From the aspect of a place to meditate and enjoy nature at its best this place ranks right up at the top. 

Images carved into the rocks were both life size and bigger and the details were amazing. This place really made me appreciate the skills of many of the workers.

440,1,4681001,en,959101974,"I hope everyone considering attending the 10-day silence Meditation Course at sun Mokh will find this review helpful of my recent experience. 

Positive Side: 
- Beautiful compound, very peaceful with lots of old wonderful trees, three ponds and nice walkways for walking meditation
- They are really strict with the rules so you can focus on your silent during the whole time
- Food is absolutely delicious, traditional Thai Food and even quite spicy (which I loved in my case),  sometimes even desserts, fruits and first and last day some hot chocolate as well
- Good itinerary for beginner with a mix between sitting and walking meditation and very long (super basic) Yoga in the morning which is really helpful to feel more comfortable in the sitting position
- Hot springs were amazing. Although you were only able to use them after breakfast and evening tea

Downside: 
- This beautiful centre would benefit so much from a passionate, kind-hearted person who runs this retreat who's got a background knowing western mindsets and speaks excellent English. This was somehow lacking and this experience stands and falls also with the teachers in my opinion
- Don't come here if you want to go really deep into meditation (there's chanting and some talking) or if you really want to learn about Buddhism (lack of good teachers that make the philosophy relatable)
- Super basic accommodation. Be prepared to sleep on a concrete. bed and wooden pillow, lots of insects, small animals, scorpions, snakes around a.s.o. washing is in washing
-The hour chanting Pali Texts with the monk wasn't helpful at all as we constantly had to translate and therefore you can't. really go deep into the chanting /meditation through chanting, so you don't learn or gain anything in my opinion
-Day 9 came only announced one day before - there's only one meal a day and that's at. 08.30 h in the morning. So, that day is super long. And after that it feels like you're kind off ready to leave and there's still another full day with the usual program, which doesn't make lots of sense. 
-It would be great to offer a Q&A sometime in the middle or offer some sort of support, just in general the whole experienced lacked some of. the loving kindness / compassion I know. from Buddhist centers otherwise. 

What you should. bring: 
- Sleeping bag (silk. inlet), comfortable. pillow and soft mattress (unless you really want the concrete bed experience)
- Mosquito spray and something for itches of the mosquito bites (the most horrible thing in the summer months, they drive you mad...), coconut oil for the small little flies
- Towel and toilet paper, all kind off toiletries (soaps, shampoos), pharmacy articles - there's only. tiny shops otherwise. you're on your own. 
-For women: Bring a sarong to use the ""shower"" and the hot springs, you need to cover up all the time
-Loose, light clothes that cover upper arms/shoulds and at least the knees, shawl, longer light jacket for the evening to cover from mosquitos
-Torch for early mornings and late evenings
-Yoga Mat (if you have your own) and clothes for Yoga
-Water drinking bottle (there's filtered water to fill up)
-Maybe some nuts of something in case you get really hungry at the beginning and your body hasn't adjusted to the light diet yet, no fresh food though, too many insects)
- plastic bag to have a trash in your room
-Washing detergent for your clothes (you do your own laundry)
-If you have- meditation cushion that you like

You can keep your diary and books, no one will control this and I found it very helpful to write down dreams and insights during the retreat, but. in general in Vipassana it's not advised to write or read anything, so that depends on your. taste. 

All in all I've found it an incredible experience, I gained wonderful insights and I would consider doing it again, but not at the same place. It was super quiet in July with only around 24 participants, in the winter it will be more crowded during high season.
I hope you find this helpful and wish you a wonderful experience if you go there. And yes, it's a challenge, but also very rewarding...",Honest review of 10 days Anapanasati-Meditation Practice at Suan Moth,Solo travel,2024-07-31,3,Wat Suan Mokkh,Nonthaburi,P03006766
441,1,4681001,en,854026155,"On the positive side:
The nature is beautiful, the hot springs really enjoyable, food is great and the 10-day set up really nice. Most people do make progress and will be happy to have endured it afterwards. Dormitories and so on are very simple but at least you have your own room/cell. This time there were around 40 participants so a fairly small group. The small shop for mosquito repellent etc is very helpful. 

Besides that:
It is focused on beginner level and not for advanced meditators with a lot of walking meditation to make it easier for everyone. Still, don‚Äôt expect too much detailed insights on the specific steps but more generic guidance with a lot of buddhism-related introductions
Its quite noisy. Morning talk, dhamma talk, food reflection, chanting, yoga / relaxation instructions are a lot for a silent retreat and disturb the calming mind. Due to the constant change between sitting and walking meditation there is also a lot of movement. Bring earplugs
Instead of yoga mats there are straw mats (more dangerous than helpful), instead of sleeping mats there are ‚Äûwooden mats‚Äú and ‚Äûwooden pillows‚Äú (strange thinking that softer mats for participants are luxurious while for coordinators/staff they are ok) and the meditation cushions have seen much better days. Bring your own stuff
Yoga instructions are focused on the course coordinator and his needs - you more or less follow that. Yoga was 105 minutes a day.
Day 10 was really a lost day due to how the program was set up with day 9 as the ‚Äûmarathon‚Äú meditation day

Really not working:
The surprising ‚Äûworking meditation‚Äú on day 10 is a terrible idea! We were expected to shovel sand for a new Wat Suan Mokh building that is even outside of the retreat areal. They probably just wanted to save some money and used us to do the work. This was announced on the afternoon itself and communicated as a meditation exercise and not as a humble request.

It was built by 18th century Chinese traders to protect them while at sea and to ensure a safe passage home.

The shrine dominates the northern skyline of Ko Sichang Harbour, and sticks out as a prominent red building halfway up the mountain at the northern end of the harbor.

The shrine itself is accessed by a steep flight of stairs, although there is now a cable car for those less fit (with appropriate donation box on arrival).  We walked up.

The d√©cor is typically Chinese.  Very colourful and apart from Buddha, the shrine includes the whole pantheon of Chinese gods.

As it is built into the side of the cliff, there are many small grotto-like shrines, each dedicated to a particular deity.  But watch your head, as the entrances to some are very low and you can do yourself a nasty injury on the low hanging rocks.

Apart from the garbage problem, I would say it was a very nice beach for children, as it was not too deep and the sand is fine-grained. ",Beautiful beach but full of rubbish,Family,2022-12-31,3,Ao Thong Takhian,Nonthaburi,P03016499

10 baht to get in was odd i initially  thought and I also  couldn't see any monks either. 
What a weird place.
Obviously this temple is meant to shock and indeed frighten people into believing if you do bad things in life there will be a price to pay.
Some brutal and scary figures are strewn across the temple as well as some sexually explicit figures which once you get over the initial shock are sort of thought provoking.
Sound affects are included with some of the scarier figures but incur a charge of 10 baht fee...only 10 baht coins can be used folks...quite a few Thai school children were there at the same time and oddly enough were left to walk/run/play around the temple unsupervised by their teachers...many of them were terrified at what they saw judging by the expressions on their faces.
I speak thai so was able to explain to them that what they were looking at wasn't real and that ghosts and demons do not exist.
Odd temple...but worth a visit as it is a culture shock especially when you consider Thailand is a pretty conservative country in so many ways.
So visit this place but bring lots of 10 baht coins with you to get the full affects of this temple/amusement park.

Created from the visions of the abbot, known as Clean Teacher Monk, the park is an exhibit of what happens to people in the afterlife, particularly the gruesome tortures they will endure for various sins.  A Dante-like theme of the punishment fitting the crime informs most of the sculptures, easy to figure out even if you can‚Äôt read the Thai language explanation signs.  Sculptures depicting the tortures for sexual offenses, in a kind of porno-horro-graphic style are the most striking, along with the large section on abortion.
       A ten baht coin gets you inside.  Besides the torture scenes, skewered torsos and bodies trapped in the earth, very tall demons stand along the paths.  At some spots you can drop a ten baht coin into a machine and listen to the screams of sinners and the ranting of demons.  Even without the sound effects it‚Äôs a pretty disturbing place.
       A small section of the garden is devoted to Heaven, with statues of Buddha, monks and saints, devotees at prayer and a very unusual ‚Äòchildren tree‚Äô with young boys and girls sprouting from the vines.   This year the temple added a new exhibit, of rural life in pre-electricity days, in the area on the other side of the hall to the right of the viharn.

The grounds are lovely, the whole place bears spending some time in reflection and meditation.  Not far from the Amari Buriram Hotel, where I was always stay. but will be hard to get to without your own wheels.

She's an excellent driver, knows the area well, has great english. Khun Oi is a lovely tour guide, driver and negotiator.
Booking a trip to Wat Khao Noi (which Khun Oi turned me onto) can be combined to a trip to Huai Chorakhe Mak,  
Huai Chorakhe Mak is a lovely wildlife preserve built on two lakes. They're are bridged by a lovely long walkway along the water front, simply spectacular. There's a lovely path that rings the lakes and you can rent bikes there and do the route easily on a bike. I just love this place and visit each time I'm in Buriram.

That being a girl sits with you, you buy her a 'lady drink' which is inevitably a TINY shot of Tequila for 250 Baht which she drinks quite quickly after which she looks at you expecting you to buy her another one. (The bottle of local beer I had cost (I think) 140 or 150 Baht). I also went to Harem and in there one girl was pushing me to buy her two drinks at once!) In exchange for this she may or may not sit or stand close to you and may or may not encourage you to put your hands on her. It could therefore be said to be an outrageous rip off but . . . we all know that right?

The girl in Devil's Playground also told me that the standard bar fine in these clubs is 2,000 Baht. The girls in these places are of a very high standard and the music in Harem and Devil's Playground is usually cool dance music. I don't go in Suzy Wong's because I don't like watching women trying to grind to rock music. But of course whether you have a good time or not all depends on the girl. If she's into you then you probably will but if she isn't then you won't. The problem some guys find with the relatively 'upmarket' places where the more attractive girls work is that they often exercise their right to say no. Sneaky attempts to gouge as much money from the customer as possible may be precede this brush off. Don't be surprised by this. Instead take a look in the mirror and ask why you've been blown out.

562,0,17642639,en,886670785,"I am rating this club 3 out of 5 based on my 4 visits on 4 consecutive & last days of my Thailand trip but actually it deserves it 5 out of 5 however there are few but very important things spoil the ratings of your club & I am rating only 3.
I would like to start with the positives first. Girls are mostly beautiful. Bar tenders, servers all are polite & did their jobs fairly well on all my 4 visits.. Music & space, sofas seating space was good. Drinks were fairly priced & good. Having said all this I would have rated it 5 out of 5 as I still consider it as one of the best bar not only in phuket but in Thailand however on my last 2 visits there were things occurred which spoiled the rating from 5 to 3.

Girl NADIA - On my 2nd visit I spotted her & I liked her very much so I asked her for drink with me but seems she was busy with other customers which I understood so while leaving I asked her if she can have a drink with me tomorrow on which she quickly agreed. I asked her twice & she agreed on both occasion that she will have drink with me tomorrow. I visited early next day & I saw her. So I asked her for a drink for which she did not even respond at all!! This was upsetting . I asked little later again but she did not even respond!! I felt disrespected not because she did not honor her own words but she did not even bother to pay any attention & say no to me.. I can accept no but what is this? Not even honoring your own words taking which the customer revisited your club.. If you don't want to drink then say at least no respectfully specially when your yourself said yes yesterday to have a drink today.. Say NO that is your right but at least respond with respect instead of ignoring the customer's request & making ugly & rude gestures . 

Even after this incident I would have rated the club at least 4 out of 5 by ignoring the incident with NADIA but similar but even worst incident occurred later days on my 3rd & 4th visit..
On my 3rd visit  I liked one girl very much her name was similar to the first one but I think it spells out little differently Nadee Or Nadeen Or Naadeen. Please check you would know.. She is tall & black open hair . I asked her for a drink with me & she came for a drink. I liked her so I asked her if she can come out with me for 1 hour she asked for 6000 & 2000 bar fine and I convinced her for 5000  & 2000 bar fine but I requested her for an appointment next day as I was very tired as I was travelling whole day & it was already 2 am. She gave me appointment time next day after mid night and we had & agreement. I bought her 3 lady drinks on our first meet & everything went fine till here. Next day as per our agreement I came by 11pm & I found her busy with other customers so I waited for her to be free. After 30 min when she got free I approached her & asked her going with me  for 1 hour as per our agreement but she refused & stated that she needs to work on the bar so I said fine I can wait till her shift is over I. E 3 am.. She did not respond to that & said she can only drink with me in the bar but can't go out.. Her english was hard to understand so I did not get the exact reason of her U turn & not being able to honor her words.i thought she was saying lady drinks first so I ordered few lady drinks for her & again asked her multiple times but she kept on saying no.. We had drinks and lap dance for almost 30 min for which I ended up paying 3000 but she refused.. Now this is very interesting.. She kept on asking for drinks & tips & I continued paying & ordering drinks for her but when I was leaving she asked for 3000 thb one drink & said if I buy this 3000 thb one drink she will not only stay with me for some more time but will go out with me next time for free!!!!! Do you think anyone will buy this offer. You couldn't honor your words & not ready to go out for 7000 thb but you are promising the customer that on next visit you will go for free!!She was good but misleading the customers making false promises to buy lady drinks & tips!! & when the time comes for honoring your words you take U turn!!

Apparently the bar goes through different phases during the week, and I happened to end up there on a very gay night.  No matter for me as most of the patrons were very cool and tolerant of straight people.  One or two were infamous perverts though and needed to be hit with a spray bottle.

I didn't get any guff from Wong or his staff. I imagine he was too busy to hassle everyone as the bar was full and everybody was buying drinks.  Yes, he did have a flashlight pointed at your face when he talked to you and I can't work out why.

You enter the beach along a road that is an arboreal archway formed by tall Casuarina Pines growing either side of the road.  This has a beauty all of its own, especially as the sunlight filters through the leafy canopy.

At one end of the beach are many small and colourful fishing boats, pulled up on the sandy beach after a night at sea.

Just behind them, locals have set up stalls selling the catch  -  fish, crabs, many varieties of prawns, and many varieties of shellfish.  This seafood market is popular with locals because the prices are right.

The food is delicious and ridiculously cheap (starting 20B/dish). At the east corner, there is a larger boat moored to the platform proposing foot massage (250B/h) and full body massage (350B/h), again very cheap.

649,1,4504759,en,666539532,"Before visiting the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, It‚Äôs worth taking at least a quick glance at the history behind the statue which is housed at its centre and after which it is named. Recorded as existing as far back as the early 1400s, the story of this statue encompasses significant parts of the history of the people and the country. Originating in the Lanna kingdom in what is now northern Thailand, and being enshrined in Bangkok at the beginning of the Chakri Dynasty, it continues to hold a central place in Thai culture, being part of major religious and royal rites annually. Understanding this really allows you to put in context what appears to be a rather small statue seen from a distance.

However this temple is not just about the statue, as the grounds contain not only amazing architecture from a variety of periods, built during restorations and renovations by previous Kings, but also a plethora of statues dotted around the area, both created in Thailand, and brought by trade from China. 

A favourite for many, including myself, is the golden chedi held up by brightly coloured yakkas, But it is worth spending some time exploring the knocks and crannies and finding beautiful bowls, statues, designs and views all over the place.

One thing to be aware of, is that due to the huge popularity of this temple and the whole area, it can get extremely busy, So be prepared for the crowds or try and make it as early as possible.",A beautiful and important piece of Thai history,NONE,2019-04-30,4,Wat Phra Kaew,Nonthaburi,P03016476

It is located north-west of Bueng Phlan Chai Lake and exactly north of the Monument of Phra Khattiyawongsa, the first ruler of Roi-et. For Thai-temple enthusiasts it has some interesting things to offer.

There is a 1200 year old chedi made from bricks. In contrary to most chedis in Thailand, this one though bell-shaped like the others, has four corners.

Behind this unusual chedi are three Buddha statues that are completely black with a shiny surface. Some sources on the internet say that a black Buddha shows a connection to Buddhism, spreading to African regions. Some of black Buddha images in India even show African facial features. But Here in Roi Et I was unable to obtain any proof for this part of history.

On entering the compound, you will pass a 39 metre tall and colourful Buddha image in meditating pose. Underneath is a prayer hall with the regular gold coloured Buddha statue, that is surrounded by several life-sized wax figures of (I assume) famous monks of the recent past.

If you go there alone and not in the high-season, you might be lucky enough (like I was) to be given the ‚Äúgrand tour of the house‚Äù by a very friendly monk and a female temple staff. Basic knowledge of some conversational Thai would definitely enhance the chat and make the meeting as enjoyable for you as it was for me. Being invited like this, by people who did not speak a single word of English made it obvious to me how less Wat Nuea is frequented by foreign visitors, but still: they approached me and spent almost an hour showing me around. And no one asked for money or a donation. Of course I donated happily to the temple before leaving.

The viharn has a graceful, triple tiered roof and the woodwork around the entrance doors feature intricate carvings of birds, plants and mythical animals, some of them gilded or decorated with colored glass.

Also made of teakwood with tiled roofs, it originally served as quarters for a stopover of a procession of a Buddha relic from Chomthong to Chiang Mai.  The building is unique in Northern Thailand.  Now Wat Ton Kwen is no longer an active temple; maintained and preserved, but not a residence for monks.  Across the road from the compound entrance lies a pool with a wooden plank bridge across it and a few empty stilted houses.

As you enter Wat Chomphu there is an old building on two floors with a spiral staircase, a gable decorated with tigers and a bell tower. Another pedestrian entrance to Wat Chomphu is very ancient and nearly falling down, with an interesting structure atop.

The main hall is dark inside but with beautiful, large pillars, interesting pictures and sculptures. Outside is a fine golden stupa with lovely golden elephants at each corner. The courtyard also contains some fitness machines which were being well used whilst I was there.

 About the food zone  There are a variety of things to eat, including savory food.  Desserts and drinks 

 As for the game arcade zone, it's fun to play and has a lot of variety, but it's a bit difficult to play. I think before you come to play, you have to think carefully.  You have to spend quite a bit of money.

 The last zone is the sales zone. There are clothes, toys, and a variety of items for sale at prices that are appropriate for the products.

I didn't understand what was going on because all the singing and chanting was in Thai, but I was thoroughly enthralled with the antics of the shadow puppets and the skill with which the puppeteers manipulated them.

You would be very lucky to find such an authentic shadow puppet show today, but this ancient Thai theatre form is kept alive and well at several places throughout Thailand.

One such is Wat Ban Don in Rayong Province, about 170 km south of Bangkok, which has been performing and preserving the art form for 200 years.

Shadow puppets, or Nang Yai in Thai, are carved from a single large piece of buffalo hide and then painted.  Backed by soft light, the puppets are moved across a screen to tell the story, accompanied by singing, chanting and music.

The art form originated in the 15th century in the southern provinces of Thailand.  The ruler of Rayong Province, Phraya Sri Samut Phokhaphai Chokchitsongkhram (Ket Yomchinda for short), heard about the puppets and hired a puppet troupe to come to Rayong to teach the art form and perform shadow puppet plays.

Wat Don Ban is now home to more than 100 puppets, some of them authenticated as 200 years old.

The shadow play stories are based on the Indian epic Ramakien or Ramayana.

But there was enough to look at and touch even there to maintain our 7yr old daughter's attention. Lots of hard science; chemistry, physics, biology, earth sciences. But also areas more toward engineering; robotics, architecture, etc. They also have some areas of physical and cultural anthropology as well as archaeology. No double-pricing for foreigners, so that's a plus. Seniors (60+) and school-aged or younger kids are free, others just 100 baht. Some of the hands-on things didn't work but really just a few. We spent 5hrs there including a lunch break and our 7yr old was dialed-in the entire time. It's quite well done and is certainly a great deal for the price.

This is a very religious place for all visitors whether Thai Buddhists or those from another country and it's important to respect the many shrines that are here.

The horses and dragons/serpents I believe are made from some kind of wax- they are amazing - although I can't be certain of that fact.

As a tourist sometimes you can overlook the importance of a place you are visiting, as was the case when we found out about the Temple Market. Its a new area a new market etc to visit, but the Temple makes it so much more and we forget that we are in someone's backyard or neighborhood and its much more to the locals. The market is only on Tuesday and Sunday evenings so the rest of the time it is all about the Temple.enjoy.",Its a privilege to see these things,NONE,2019-08-31,4,Wat Suwan Khiri Khet,Pathum Thani,P03017199

1. The Mona Lisa of Nan = A beautiful woman wearing her hair in a bun after finished taking a bath.

2. The Noble Woman = A noble lady in traditional dress smoking a cigarette, since the smoke from the tobacco can keep away mosquitos and harmful insects.

3. The Noble Man = A noble man smoking a cigarette. Notice that he has tattoos from his belly down to his knees according to the local tradition.

4. At the boat dock = Group of young people meet for dating at the boat dock. If a man is interested in a woman, he will ask her to light a cigarette. If the woman is interested in him, she will offer to light his.

For decades, the trees around Wat Phai Lom were the winter nesting sanctuary for hundreds, if not thousands, of Asian open-billed storks.  The scene was truly fantastic and the cool-season nesting site attracted thousands of human visitors to see the fabulous sight of the graceful migratory birds.  The stork chicks and fledglings were especially endearing to observe!

For years, the human visitors spent considerable amounts of money on snacks and drinks and obviously contributed generously to the temple during their pilgrimages to the stork sanctuary.  In a stupendously idiotic tragedy, however, the temple abbot and decision makers went on a huge construction binge, knocking down trees, piling up construction materials, making loud disturbing noises, and otherwise making the area unattractive to the nesting storks. To make a long story short, they managed to ""kill the storks that laid the golden eggs.""  The storks got fed up with the disruptions to their mating and nesting and abruptly stopped returning to the temple grounds about five years ago (various reports are that the storks are now nesting in Buriram, Nakon Sawong, Nakon Chaisi, and elsewhere).

The temple grounds are now blighted by a huge temple building dedicated to the storks that no longer visit (unmaintained, falling apart, and home to a large number of pigeons), a crumbling giant sculpture of stork, and a large empty parking lot.

It teaches at first how the rock was made, how it gets soft, and how it gets hard. Now you will think how could a rock could be soft? But it is true. Before it gets hard, the rock will be soft. It gets hard because all of the rain, wind, and the sun! Before I didn‚Äôt go to the museum, I didn‚Äôt know even a tiny bit of rocks and museum. But now, I know way more than my 14 years old big sister. Now you know Geological Recourse Museum‚Äôs first reason to go. But there is two more reasons to go, so don‚Äôt be tired reading now!    

Some Kind of Special! 
->Geological Recourse Museum has some kind of special! It means it has a special event. Are you sad I said event, not events? If you hear what I say you will be happy than sad. Are you ready to listen? All righty then, really? Okay, it has a place where you can find a fossil with a brush. Like there is a place where‚Äôs sand over the sand. Get it? And one more thing is there is no people but they could go any moment. So if you go faster, the better. Are you very excited now that you are begging your parents now? You would be never sad if you try the event. Trust me, it‚Äôs true!	

Best Place Ever!	
->Now you heard my two reasons but remember there is one more reason left! I told you there was a museum that had lot of teaching and some kind of special. But there is one more to hear! Next to the Geological Recourse Museum, there is a shop where you can buy rocks and minerals. I told you there was somewhere where you could buy mineral and rock collections but this is a different place! But sometimes the shop closed. But you could still go  next to the shop and look what there is! Even though the shop is closed, there is a place where there is rocks and minerals lying on the floor. And the best part is that it‚Äôs... FREE!!! I didn‚Äôt buy the rocks on the shop but sometimes it better if you do. You have to make a good choice. It‚Äôs your choice!

Conclusion:   
->Now you heard my three reasons are you going to run out of your house? If you like this review, you‚Äôre going to like my other ones, too. I hope you enjoy your trip!

Tha Phae Gate is located at the heart of the city, offering convenient access to explore the surrounding area. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby, providing opportunities for dining and entertainment.

We were then able to feed all the elephants and speak to their person. After that we went and was shown how to prepare the sugarcane and make the herby balls and then went to feed those to the elephants. We were provided water and watermelon throughout to ensure we were hydrated. 
We then went to bath our elephant (we chose the grandma Sandy), it was such an incredible moment. 
All of this was also documented through photos and videos for us by our guide and there was even a photographer who came down to take some photos whilst we were bathing the elephants. 
Once this was done we headed back to the seating area and we're blown away by being provided a photo frame with 3 photographs from the day at no extra cost. We tipped Sandy's handler (Da) and the Sanctuary for providing us memories which will last a lifetime. 
We were also provided a voucher for lunch at the Memories bar which was a few minutes walk down the road at the beautiful beach and then picked up again to be taken back to our hotel.

Sadly, we did not get that lucky. But we did see a bunch of monkeys and a very cool reptile.
The park has several trails ranging 1-8km with waterfalls and rope bridges. So lots of choices. We saw a really gorgeous waterfall, I think it was Haew Narok waterfall.

Arriving at the mountain, you are offered the option to hire a guide which I didn't mind  just in case something would happen. There are thousands of starving monkeys so be very careful when feeding them. Just buy a banana basket from one of the carts and TOSS THE WHOLE THING don't throw one by one as you will see it will quickly escalate into a screaming frenzy. 

To go up the mountain peak is very steep. AVOID if you have vertigo or fear of heights. It will start with a flight of stairs which can be hard if you have bad cardio. But you can also take your time and reset. After the stairs you have to climb up metal ladders, no straps and no safety so BE VERY CAREFUL. Once at the top it will look majestic. There's a sitting Buddha and bells. Very bucolic and worthy of an Instagram moment.

The next place to visit is near the temple. There's a flight of colorful stairs that will take you up to a reclining Buddha closed behind gates. You need a guide to take you in. Ask him to show the bats or say ""kangaw"" in Thai they will understand. There's a secret entrance behind the Budhha where you will witness thousands of bats hovering in silence. 

The last thing to see is the flight of a million bats that come out at the beginning of sunset, around 6pm. Head to the food court at the entrance and look at the peaks past the city hall office. Otherwise you can also ask the locals they know. You can enjoy an amazing cheap meal at the family operated restaurant. Beware of the monkey that will snatch your food when  you aren't looking.

One last thing to know, this place isn't a sanitized theme park. You will come real close with wildlife. It's also a bit run down and the smell of monkey feces is everywhere (it is their home after all).

Note that I am just an amateur hiker so the bar is pretty low but note that there were people who turned around and no longer climbed to the top. The reason is because the scariest part of the climb are the very steep metal ladders that you need to take before reaching the peak. The ladders are made up of large metal pipes which are around 4-5 inches in diameter and are inclined at about 60-70 degrees steep. Yes, almost vertical. Each step were spaced far apart that anyone with short legs will have a hard time climbing them. Also, there were no flat platform on each step, but only that thick round metal pipe. Good thing that it wasn‚Äôt raining that day, or else, if the stairs are slippery then we would‚Äôve turned around also. And the scary part is that if you slip, then you‚Äôll fall a considerable height, around 2 stories high. Experience may differ from person to person, but my legs were shaking when going down. Remember that by the time that you get to the stairs part, you‚Äôll be pretty much tired already.

After conquering the hike, you‚Äôll be rewarded with an amazing view! I know you have already seen the pictures. It‚Äôs really really good.

By the way, the place is full of monkeys and there is secure parking area which reminded me of zombie movie scenes wherein when going in, someone has to open the gate and stay guard so that no monkey comes close then you have to close the gate quickly again afterwards. The keeper uses a broom to scare them off. There‚Äôs a donation box which we just put money as there was no more attendant when we left. Please be careful with your stuff, donlt bring plastic bags as the monkeys will think that it‚Äôs food and try to take it from you.

I don‚Äôt think that there were public transportation to this place. We had a car that we rode from Bangkok to here.

From Wikipedia we learn that In 1907 the Thai-Cambodian border was mapped by the French on behalf of a bilateral border commission. According to the 1904 agreement, the border would follow the natural watershed between the countries. However, the resulting map deviated by showing Preah Vihear Temple as being in Cambodia, even though it is on the Thai side of the watershed. Thailand accepted the map for official use. The Thais discovered the error when they made their own survey in the 1930s, but the International Court of Justice ruled that they had waited too long to protest and lost the temple by ""acquiescence"". 
So now you can only visit the temple from the Cambodian side. For those with strong interest in the political and historical aspects one could go in from the Thai side. Entrance is 400 baht for a foreigner. But for the politically not interested there is not much to see.

Off the beaten path lies Wat Samphran, also known as the ‚ÄúDragon Temple.‚Äù It is located approximately 15 min from After the Rain Coffee & Gallery (20 min from Bubble in the Forest Cafe).

There is no admission fee to enter this Buddhist temple. However, donations are highly requested.

Showcasing a unique mix of Thai and Chinese architecture, this 17-story pink tower features a giant green dragon encircling the entire temple. The paint colors have faded over the years, but doesn‚Äôt take away from how truly stunning it is. 

The dragon‚Äôs body is hollow and is essentially a winding tunnel. For a small donation, you can walk up the length of the dragon, all the way up to the rooftop. 

The dragon wrapped around the tower from bottom to the top symbolizes the ‚Äúascent to enlightenment - from sorrow to happiness and from hell to heaven.‚Äù

An elevator is available if climbing up a dragon‚Äôs body isn‚Äôt your cup of tea. However, a donation of 10 THB per person is requested.

Footwear must be removed prior to entering the temple, so come prepared with socks. Despite fans spread throughout the tunnel, it was still blazing hot. 

Since this is an active temple, monks were to be expected. However, I didn‚Äôt expect female monks! ALL of the monks we encountered as we walked through the temple grounds were female. 

I had donned a light cardigan to adhere to the temple‚Äôs dress code, but it seemed like they weren‚Äôt too strict about it. Several female visitors had exposed shoulders and were still able to enter the temple. 

Larger than life pictures of the past and present King and Queen of Thailand are displayed prominently near the temple‚Äôs entrance. Please note, it is a crime to speak disrespectfully of the Thai Royal family and is punishable with jail time.

We start by feeding the elephants - wow they are such amazing animals so gentle and so much personality. It is amazing to watch them eat with their trunks - they use their trunks for everything!! Then we walk with them over to the pond and get in the water and bath them (this is when you get wet!!) It is a really great experience.

What an incredible experience at Elephant Rescue Park. And ‚Äòrescue‚Äô is exactly the right word because the elephants all had a difficult past and are now living a very caring, free and wonderful life together with the great help of the carers.

Our 2 guides, Mr Shawn and Mr Chai were great company and enjoyed every minute in their and their colleagues company. 
They picked us up by minibus from our hotel in the centre of Chiang Mai
We first fed the elephants, walked a beautiful route in the nature and then washed and scrubbed the elephants in the lake with the clothes, hats and boots we were given.
After that a fresh and tasty lunch too.
Plenty of time for photos during the trip. They also have a photographer who takes really nice photos for a certain price.

During Ayutthaya period, Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) reigned the kingdom and had Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai as his wife. The Burmese army surrounded Ayutthaya by using the invasion route via the Three Pagodas Pass from Kanchanaburi to the west, and then to the capital Ayutthaya. The King  mounted his war elephant in preparation for battle. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai (the Queen) was so worried that she dressed in military attire and followed them on a war elephant. When the Ayutthaya army had faced the vanguard of the Burmese army , Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) engaged the enemy  but the elephant charged away from the enemy. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai, therefore, charged ahead between the King and the Viceroy to block his pursuit and was fatally injured. Whenever the Burmese saw that it was a lady killed in battle they stopped.

The guides couldn't tell us when an elephant had last been seen - saying they thought there was 1 elephant in the park. Lots of people there to see them but none to be seen.
A little thought and they would have the elephants fitted with a tracking device or they could use a drone to locate any elephants.
It was a long drive there and back and we spent at least an hour searching to no avail.
Maybe there are more elephants at other times of the year (we were there at the end of the dry season). But I wouldn't recommend based on our experience.

This is an out of the way place, not far from Lamai but very much off the beaten track - even our local driver had never been and required GPS navigation to get there.
The road leading to the waterfall is very rough. Most drivers/cabs would not go down this road, thankfully our driver was really nice and was driving a modern 4x4 so he pretty much took us as far as you can by car/scooter.
Make sure you have no knee problems cos it's pretty steep and it can get very slippery when going through the forest to access the waterfall. When you get there you are greeted with 3 levels of waterfall. They aren't huge by any means but they are lovely to look at. When we got there there was only one other person taking pictures. It's very quiet so you can hear all the sounds of the forest around you. 
Afterwards we returned to rest at the lookout area at the entrance to the waterfall and it did not disappoint. 360 panoramic views of the forest and mountains. Spectacular.

1580,4,4322677,en,753017141,"The Wat Khun Inthapramun (InPramun) is a Buddhist temple which is located in Pho Thong, Ang Thong. The temple is located in a rural area (in the rice fields) about 10 Km North of Ang Thong town. On the grounds are the ruins of several ancient temple buildings & chedis. The largest reclining Buddha in Thailand is enshrined here.
 The main attraction of this sacred temple is the white reclining 50 meters long Buddha statue (Luang Phor Khao). The image was built at the Sukhothai era (7 centuries ago). The image of the reclining Buddha represents the entry of Buddha into Nirvana and the end of All reincarnations.
According to the legend, Khun Inthapramun was a royal tax collector and he used some of the tax for building a sacred object. Being discovered that, he was sentenced to death and his remains buried there. And temple was called Wat Khun Inthapramun.
We drove (about 15 km) from Wat Muang to Wat Khun Inthapramun. The navigation was somehow difficult and the navigating programs were not enough for finding the temple. So we asked the locals for the proper route, which was leading to the Wat. 
Currently the reclining Buddha is staying outdoor, it's not within the temple, since the original temple has been destroyed for a long time, Only the ruins of the pillars have remained. Around the reclining Buddha image there are some large trees and vast nice greenery. A new high-tech main hall has been built recently (for the temple) which has both elevator and escalator for the visitors. 
There's a very interesting attraction beside the Reclining Buddha, It's a vivid colorful outdoor market that sells Thai eatables and Thai, Buddhist souvenirs. The atmosphere of here is really friendly and peaceful and relatively not crowded.

1581,1,4322677,en,602250380,"I visited Wat Khun Inthapramun in 1 July 2018. Wat Khun Inthapramun is ancient temple that was constructed during the Sukhothai period, its vast size still outlined by brick ruins. The largest and longest reclining Buddha statue in Thailand, 50 meters from topknot to feet, is enshrined here.  Originally, the reclining Buddha image was housed in the image hall, or Wihan, but after a fire raged through the temple, the image was abandoned to the elements for hundreds of years. Many Thai kings have paid homage to the image, including King Borommakot in 1753, King Rama V in 1878 and 1908, as well as the current king, who presented royal Kathin robes in 1973 and 1975.
Inside an all-purpose pavilion, there is a statue of Khun Inthapramun (a much-storied figure) as well as his presumed remains. According to legend, Khun Inthapramun was a revenue officer who secretly embezzled from the government to build the massive Buddha image. When the King asked how he obtained the funds, Khun Inthapramun did not reveal the truth because he was afraid that merit from the construction of the image would be passed on to the King. He was finally sentenced to death.
There are three ways to get to the temple. First, take Ang Thong - Amphoe Pho Thong Route (Route No. 3064), then take a right turn at Km 9 for approximately 2 kilometers.  Or take the road from Sing Buri province towards Amphoe Chaiyo and take a left turn at approximately Km 64-65 for 4 kilometers to reach the temple. Alternatively, take the Amphoe Wiset - Chai Chan Pho Thong Route (along the irrigation canal road) and take a right turn when arriving at  Amphoe Pho Thong.

We took the 10 a.m. train from Lampang and arrived in the cute little station of Khun Tan at 11 a.m. You can leave your backpack at the station.  

From the station to the park's entrance, count 20 minutes by foot. At the time of visit (dec.2019), the entrance to the park was 100 baht. The visitor center at the entrance provides a free map of the park. There's also a small restaurant and a shop selling water bottles, among other things. 

There was only one trail, going to the summit. The other trail (towards the waterfall) seems to be closed since quite a while. 

The first part of the trail (from the visitor center to camp 1 (""yom 1"") lasts about 2km and is partly on the road. There are shortcuts cutting the road's hairpins. 

At camp 1, names and phone numbers (in case of emergency) are written down in a register. Looking at the register, I could see that only 14 persons were taking the hike the same day as myself. Although it was high season, Doi Khun Tan was not touristy at all. 

It took approx. 2h00 to cover the 5km from camp 1 to the summit. Adding the time needed to go from the train station to camp 1 (through the visitor center), I believe 2h30 at a ""normal"" pace is a realistic estimation to reach the summit.To go back down, two hours will suffice.

The trail is very well marked and easy to follow. No crossings, no confusion possible : it's all very straigt-forward. In december, the trail could be done without specific hiking shoes. In the wet season, this might be different.

I went to his website later on, made a donation to his cause whatever that is, and came out to see this temple he stays at. I know they gotta serious meditative Vipasanna thing going here, but it's a little too much for me: people all dressed in white, some oddly walking slowly in measured steps, some sitting in meditation with their eyes closed (a big no-no for me when I practice), and everything's just too eerily quiet.

Admission was free. There is an old stupa, clusters of buildings with individual cells for meditators, bungalows, kitchen and dining hall as well as some other buildings. It was peaceful inside the compound. We spent about 30 minutes here to look around and capture some pictures. Since the temple is a bit out of the way, it can be difficult to find a ride for the return trip, so it would be advisable to book a round trip and have the driver wait.

Personally I found the food excellent and struggled to not overeat (too much food = sluggish mind).

The instructors, especially Meichi Saree, are helpful and deeply compassionate. Phra Ajahn Suphan, the abbot and head teacher, has been at the monastery since he was 15 (35+ years ago) and is a kind and patient teacher.

I will say that if you're looking for a place that is extremely strict and serious, this is not it. They tell you not to talk and put signs up, but people do and nobody stops them. If you want to have a fruitful practice, refuse the urge to socialize at all, or even to make eye contact! It seems pleasant, but just gives the mind something to latch onto.

If you grabbed one and let it go away (like us) instead of waiting for you, this might not be such a good idea as it will be difficult to get one back.

A host of stalls line site roads or unfold under trees and there is a fairly large central food area to recharge your batteries.
I went shopping first and ended up buying everything from teak wood floral painted mobile phone stands to brass embroidered book marks.
It got hotter and hotter so I briefly broke off to get myself a bag of fresh sliced pineapple before continuing to browse the stalls and also a large area of farmers' produce which was doing brisk business with the crowds.
Entry to the market was free, the toilets there were clean and well kept and large parts of the market were accessible for disabled people and wheelchairs.

This architectural gem, dating back to the early 19th century, is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of cultural diversity and harmony within the fabric of Thai society.

The Ton Son Mosque, also known as Masjid Ton Son or Ton Son Islamic Center, has a history dating back over a century. Built in 1849 during the reign of King Rama III, it stands as one of the oldest mosques in Bangkok. Its construction was initiated by Haji Sulong, a prominent Muslim merchant of the time, and it has since served as a focal point for the Muslim community in the area.

One of the most striking features of the Ton Son Mosque is its unique architectural style, which blends traditional Thai design elements with Islamic motifs. The mosque's fa√ßade is adorned with intricate carvings and colorful tiles, reflecting the artistic fusion of Thai and Islamic influences. Its minaret, crowned with a golden dome, stands tall against the Bangkok skyline, offering a picturesque sight that captures the essence of Islamic architecture.

Staff were excellent and very helpful.

Want to conclude with a special note to our native English teacher.  He brought the balance of education and fun seamlessly.

I recommend you go early!! I think that's best for two reasons: 1) there are less people generally and 2) (perhaps more importantly), the sun is behind Buddha after 1pm so good photos are much harder to get until maybe after 5pm.

(Thai roads are not for beginners on scooters.) The tallest Buddha statue in gold can only be described as something worth seeing. It's not a mainstream tourist venue because of its remote location, and the fact that most tourists don't get to tour in Ang Thong province. If it were located near Bangkok it would be on every tour guides list of compulsory trips.

For me what was more impressive was the temples in the grounds of the Big Buddha statue. They are stunning. I've been to 50 temples or more, but these are in the top 10. One is hung wall to wall with artworks of incredible detail and high interest for scholars of Thailand history. They depict so much of Thai folklore and culture. Another is mirrored in and out, and simply breathtaking.
Of course there is much variety of food available, and shady places to sit and enjoy. Souvenir shops show off local wares, as well as the ""normal junk"". Something for everyone. If you have an extended stay, or if you've been to all the usual top 10 sites in Thailand, then this should be added to your list.
Nearby is another almost totally unknown temple which you can ask your driver to take you to, which will make it a full day trip out of Ang Thong town. It's called the Wat Ta It. It will add an additional 2 hours to your trip, but you'll never see anything like it anywhere else in Thailand. Call it a hidden secret. It about 7 stories high, built in a style of a pyramid.

(1) the biggest Buddha image in Thailand, standing at 90 metres including its platform and dominating the surrounding pancake-flat countryside, and
(2) the life-size dioramas in its grounds. There is a whole set of these, most make up a ""hell garden"" where the punishments inflicted on sinners in the afterlife and graphically displayed (some may be put off by this, Thais seem less squeamish about gore than Westerners ) while others represent scenes from mythology and Thai history.  Notices explain what is going on in each enclosure, in Thai only, but Google Translate helped make things clearer.
You can make a day trip of it from Bangkok (taxi and driver for the day, cost us about 3,000 baht) and take in something else on the way. For that I recommend Wat Niwet.

The temple is located in a cave, you reach it by climbing a few steps, that are a little slippery. Beware of different step heights.

There are a lot of Monkeys there with some baby monkeys, that were absolutely beautiful! If you behave like a person with a brain, they won‚Äôt harm you. Just some tips:

1. Get rid of that stupid bamboo stick! When monkeys know, they will get beaten with this stick, how do you think they will welcome you? 

2. Keep distance to Chinese tourists (sorry to those, who can behave). Except from the noise they emerge in a holy place... They run around screaming loud and forming groups with bamboo sticks around them when there is a monkey around... they try to hit them even when they just sit there...

3. Don‚Äôt feed monkeys with your trash, try to keep plastic away. There is nothing more sad to see than a monkey chewing on plastic stuff. :-(

4. Animals this size will never attack you, unless they feel threatened. Of course if you are loud and threaten them with a bamboo stick, they might have to defend themselves. Then don‚Äôt whine on here if they won the fight you started! 

I was standing on the stairs with monkeys around me in a distance of 0.5 meters. They didn‚Äôt even care I was there and were playing around. It was a beautiful scene to watch...

Apparently, this part of town was the original centre of Phitsanulok during the Khmer era (often referred to in Thailand as the ‚ÄòLopburi‚Äô period).

This review is pertintent first to the independent traveller; second to one that wants a day excursion outside Chiang Mai; and third to any one wishing to avoid the crowds that populate Wats like Doi Suthep and Chedi Luang. 

Do this trip for the rural scenery and for a much different Wat experience. You can do this trip by car, motorbike or songthaews. Bicycling is not a reasonable day trip and as tough a climb as Wat Doi Suthep. 

Expect to take about 3-4 hours roundtrip to the Wat or more if you take a wrong turn.  Aim your vehicle north to Mae Rim, then start looking for signs on the left directing you to turn west (a Buddha footprint is most helpful when seen). Info from travelfish.org states 5km to the sign but just where to begin counting that is very uncertain. I must have started too late as we drove only 2km.  Follow signs and Buddha footprints for 25 km, but don't miss a left hand turn at about 12-13 km where we saw neither footprints or the English temple's name.  We were trying at that point without GPS because it failed over and over to recognise the Wat until we ran words together. That is to say we missed this turn; GPS or a very detailed map is mandatory and a time saver. 

Otherwise enjoy the rural Thai countryside and observe Thai lifestyle. This is rural mountain driving and passing other vehicles is always ""interesting"" even with concrete road all the way. You have arrived when you pass through a huge concrete gate where upon you can view the smaller temples first or continue driving 300+ meters to the main attraction.

2122,1,13199053,en,559761741,"First and foremost, the unique aspects of this spa are 1) the ambience - most spas in Bangkok are decorated in a very Thai style while this one is very modern, white and clean, 2) the oils used - this is what intrigued me to try this spa out is the type of oils they use. While most spas use lavender and rose oils, here they have massage treatments that use almond oil, macadamia oil and coconut oil which is really intriguing for someone with very dry skin such as myself. As this was my first time, I went for one of their more basic packages which involves a 60-minute almond oil massage and a 30-minute warm organic coconut oil massage where they combed the hot coconut oil into my roots gently and then massaged it into my scalp before masking it in a shower cap during the body massage. The almond oil was very moisturising and the tension was just right, I fell asleep at some intervals. There was a lot of stroking with palms and kneading which was an interesting change from the standard Thai massage most are used to. The service is also very friendly, I had a cough and the therapist got me some warm water mid-way. The only down side I see so far is that because it is a boutique spa, they don't have many facilities and I love steam rooms. However, all spas offer different things and this is a definite must-try for someone who wants a good massage using highly moisturising and natural oils that really work to soothe dry skin.",De-stress Package,Solo travel,2018-02-28,5,Urban Retreat Spa - Phrom Phong,Sing Buri,P03015668
2123,1,2667297,en,899752994,"This review is for the Asian Herb Association massage shop on Sukhumvit.  There is no listing for it on TA. But I suspect all branches are exactly the same.

This was a huge disappointment.  At the beginning I felt ok, but then things got bad.  

The first issue is there are no beds.  You lay on the floor.   I have been getting massages once a week for over 20 years.  I consider myself an expert already as I use the techniques from multiple therapists at home on my family and myself.  The one thing I can tell you is that using towels on the floor bed are not very good for the neck.

I did not feel too bad afterwards, but I have neck issues and was greatly worried.

The biggest issue was firstly the therapist, and if the massage shop figures out who I am and you take money away from her because I am complaining on a public forum, shame on you!   The therapist did listen somewhat as I told the staff and her that I wanted a hard massage.  Well... the therapist basically mumbled that if you want a hard massage choose a Traditional Thai massage. Well, I cannot. I have a disk herniation and that is how it started, with a traditional Thai massage, so please do not tell me what kind of massage I need, I know my body and I know what I need and what I do not need.

By far the worst thing here is the staff's attitude.  After the massage I tried to convey to the staff that they need beds, and some other things, all the lady did was nod her head and say yes yes yes like she didn't care one bit, you know the attitude I am talking about, like yeah, we customers have no idea what we are talking about and the staff is not going to listen to one word of our complaint.  This is just very poor taste and poor service.  I was shocked that this happened at this place, as many people talk it up.  And it was recommended to me from a Thai person. The staff are overly arrogant and rude.   I will never return because of that.   

You can go if you want, I am not telling you not to, but you need to consider your options to be honest.

Also the price is higher, and for that kind of attitude, it is not worth it to me.","Arrogant attitudes of staff, don't listen to customers, rude",Solo travel,2022-12-31,1,Asia Herb Association - Phrom Phong Shop,Sing Buri,P03015668

After having moved his capital from Luang Prabang to Vientiane in the mid-16th century, King Setthathirath ordered here a stupa built over the ancient one as a demonstration of his faith. Setthathirath's pagoda became heavily damaged over the years and toppled in 1970. The stupa was renovated by the Fine Arts Department in 1976-77.

The only 2 things free are swimming in the sea and sitting on the rocks at the far end.
The prices are expensive and everything is fixed. Be sure to ask for the price before buying something. Here's a few items they were selling:

- Rental for wooden deck (beach folding chair) - 150 baht for 2 chairs for unlimited time (until your boat calls you back)
- Coconut - 150 baht per unit
- Fruit juice - 150 baht per unit
- Lays chips (small) - 60 baht per unit
- Roasted corn - 50 baht per unit
- Toilet/restroom - 20 baht per entry per person

After being forced to take a tour, you get to hear all these positive messages about the symbolism such as respect your elders, take care of the environment, be kind to animals, and take care of your family, country, and community. Of course, good messages, but actions speak louder than words or symbols.
 You pass the shrine to Mother Earth and are told 'we all must do our part', only to walk outside to the sea and discover a mile+ long by 10meter wide floating pile of plastic and garbage in the seaside. (If they spent only a fraction less effort in paying low income laborers to clean up the sea opposed to hand chiselling shrines to Mother Earth Godesses out of Old Growth trees, that seaside would be cleaner and the message would be more than idillic words.). Not to mention supplying pottable drinking water to the people and saving millions of plastic water bottles from polluting the whole country side and ocean. 
Then you see the carving of a man rescuing a dog from a torrentially flowing river and you remember the 100's if not 1000's of stray/ferral dogs and cats sleeping on roads and dying alone of disease etc. I wont even go into the elephant riding situation found here. A sacred animal used to hold obese western tourists and walk in cicrcles in the summer heat on pavement.
Then you hear the great messages about taking care of your children and Family and then recall the girls selling themselves on Beach Road and being sold to 50+ year old white men for 'ping pong' shows. Who's children are these teenagers and where is the modo from the sanctuary in action. 
Back to 'Mother Earth' and the shrine to her. The irony here is massive but may be overlooked by the great carpentry. Up north I got to see the last lone male Gibbon in an entire region. A population destined for extirpation and possibly exiction; habitat loss and human influence would be top reasons. Here, you have a shrine to Mother Earth made out of old growth tropical hardwoods (aka gibbon habitat amongst other species such as Tigers).
Then you think, maybe this place would be nice to meditate in. But I am unsure when they will ever allow few enough people to allow for the same kind of spiritual awakening one can already find in nature such as the old Gibbon habitats and clean shores of days gone by.
This place is another tourist trap. Will make a ton of money, but not sure how many more dogs it will save, how much more in touch people will become with nature, or how many more teenage women will get engineering degrees instead of Master's Degrees in Ping-Pong shows?

The sheer scale of the place was overwhelming. It felt like a giant, intricate puzzle, with each piece telling a different part of the story. He explained that the Sanctuary is still under construction, and the carvings are constantly evolving. This gave the whole experience a sense of dynamism, like witnessing a work of art in progress.
 
What struck me most was the sheer dedication of the artists. He told us that every single carving is done by hand, using traditional techniques. He even showed us some of the tools they use, which were incredibly simple yet incredibly effective.
 
The Sanctuary wasn‚Äôt just about the carvings, though. It was about the atmosphere. The air was filled with the scent of incense and the sound of birdsong. You could feel a sense of peace and tranquility, even amidst the throngs of tourists.

If you REALLY want to go, I recommend wearing a thick sarong over your head/shoulders to monkey-proof yourself a bit, and then also carry a stick to shoo them away. 

It looks cool to take a few photos, but if you get bitten, and I believe that quite a few people are, it's not worth the disruption to your holiday. 

 Rabies is endemic to Thailand, and even though you have a small chance of developing rabies after a bite, you should get the vaccine,  because the disease is deadly and un-treatable.

Peak Season: The Bua Tong flowers bloom between November and December, making this the most suitable time to visit. Plan and book your accommodation and transportation well in advance, especially during peak season, as it can get crowded.

 You can reach the area by taking a bus or van from Chiang Mai, the nearest major city. Alternatively, renting a car or motorbike provides more flexibility for exploring the surrounding areas.

Some of these ‚Äòidyllic‚Äô shots can cause over reaction in our judgement and increase anticipation. The result can be that when we actually see the object with our own eyes, the ‚Äòreal‚Äô sight does not live up to the perceived images or our embroidered expectations.

Whilst I have been wanting to visit Thung Bua Tong Fields at Doi Mae U Kho, I was slightly concerned that this maybe a case of over expectation but was jubilant to discover that, in reality, this spectacular sight was much more that I had ever anticipated. It has left deep impressions.

From Khun Yuam on Route 108 turn up further into the mountains on route 1263 it‚Äôs a good road that twists and climbs for about 25kms. Finally, at an altitude of 1,600 meters one starts to see the yellow hillside and shortly one is surrounded by the masses of bright yellow ‚ÄòSunflowers‚Äô.

Commonly known as the Tree Marigold the plants are from the family Asteraceae and also called Mexican Sunflowers and Nitobe chrysanthemum, amongst others. Whether they are true sunflowers or not is irrelevant as one leaves the car and is enveloped by this cornucopia of 2-meter+ tall swaying bushes of yellow delight.

The development here is quite tasteful. Yes, there is a winding road that passes through these fields, but traffic is minimal and respectful. There are a variety of trails that one can explore through the tunnels of flowers. Conveniently placed view-points afford magnificent vistas over the flowers to the surrounding mountains. Whilst there are toilets there are no commercial shops or cafes to disturb the scenery or clear alpine air.

The flowers bloom at their best sometime between the beginning of November until the second week of December. We visited on November 16th and I believe that the conditions could not have been better. One is recommended to visit either early morning or late afternoon (as we did), to enjoy the best views. It really is breath-taking, awe-inspiring, almost surreal, hypnotic and even spiritual as one attempts to absorb all that one is seeing within an aura of quietness and respect from the other visitors. 

It is a photographer‚Äôs dream, and one could probably spend 24 hours there to take in both the sunrise and the sunset. I believe that it is possible to camp, and a simple mountain resort is relatively nearby but apologies, I did not get the name 

For me it was one of the most inspirational sights that I have had the privilege to witness. I have heard it likened to the alpine meadows from the Sound of Music, but this does not do the Bua Tong Sunflower Fields justice. They are magical and we were truly so fortunate to visit when we did with the flowers in full bloom, spectacular panoramas over the mountains, a clear blue sky and few other visitors. Add this to your bucket list, no lifetime is complete without this experience.

As we descended down onto to the beach we were approached by a security guard and asked to sign in. The beach actually belongs to Centara beach resort, so they record who arrives on the beach and as they leave. Think all non-hotel guests had to be off the beach by 18.00.

It is a secluded stretch of beach in a cove with golden sands, flanked at both ends by dramatic headland with cliffs and washed by the water's of the Andaman Sea. 

Like the other beaches there are no facilities here, sunbeds or umbrellas. The only shade here is provided by the cliffs and some trees along the beach.

There are no shops, restaurants or bars here, so for those visitors intending to spend some time here, everything required for the stay if brought with you. 

One of the features on the beach is the Pai Plong Floating Pier, which we walked along to the end. From the Pier it was the nearest we got on land to the  impressive Ao Nang Tower,  some wonderful views. 

Nearby the Pier there are some canoes for hire. It is possible to purchase a day pass to use the facilities of the Hotel, no idea how much this costs.

We stayed here long enough to walk the length of the beach and Pier and enjoy the scenery, we then walked back to Ao Nang along the Monkey Trail.

It was a very unusal way to get to a beach, via the Monkey Trail, there was some wonderful scenery including Ao Nang Tower.

A short lane and an arched bridge take you to Wat Tham Tham Osot. The entrance to the Cave is at the rear of the Pavillion next to the striking gold Buddha. The cave appears to be more sandstone in nature than the typical limestone caves in the region.

This is the second of two caves along the headland both have rather unusal shrines in them. However this is larger of the two caves, as result has more contents inside it.

There was a bit of confusion and no clear information about the names of the Cave. For the purposes of this review, this one is Phra Nang Cave and the smaller one is Princess Cave.

Having visited the smaller cave first we were neither surprised nor shocked to see the contents of this Cave and it's shrine.

A statue of Phra Nang sits on a table, with legs crossed, holding  a bowl in front of her. The Shrine is surrounded by colourful floral tributes and pieces of cloth. There are two smaller statues perched behind Phra Nang, one on either side of her.

Around the cave there are vast numbers of wooden phalluses, erect penises, in all shapes and sizes and painted in different colours and embedded in the sand. There is a pile, towards the rear of the Cave of discarded phalluses. 

The Cave is a sacred place and should be treated with respect by visitors. Fishermen and boatmen come here  to make floral  offerings and burn incense ensuring a safe return journey from sea.

There is a sign requesting that visitors do not leave the following five items for Phra Nang as  ""she is Indian, not a God and she believes in the phallus or Ungam as a symbol of the Hindu God Shiva"".

The items are sex toys, red water, red flowers, traditional Thai costumes or strange offerings.

There are many legend and myths about who Phra Nang was, one is she was an Indian princess who was killed in a shipwreck nearby and her ghost occupies the cave.

Another story says that Phra Nang was the wife of a local fisherman, whose husband was lost at sea and she lived her life in the cave waiting for his return. 

Fishermen and boatmen still make offerings in the form of incense and flowers to ensure a safe journey. They believe that Phra Nang, Princess Goddess lives in the Cave under the cliff

We fell in love with the area back then and all though the cave area has barely changed the area around has definitely grown with new development. 

We did not venture into the cave this time round as we'd done years before. Back then when the weather was cooler and temps low the cave was hot and humid therefore I wasn't keen to test how hot it would be while temps were high. 
We happily wandered the area in the shade and had some amazing ice teas. We reminisced on how amazing and serene Chiang Dao area was and still is and how little the immediate vicinity has changed, thank goodness.

On entering we had to lie down as the ceiling of the cave was about a foot to 18 inches above our heads.  This was only for a very brief time.  We then entered a larger chamber and eventually docked the boat and got out and walked through some of the cave.  Very nice I thought.  Then we got back into the boat and instead of exiting the way we had come in we went out a different way.  This is when it got really interesting.  We had to lie down in the boat and the space between my nose and the ceiling kept shrinking until it was only an inch or less.  A couple of times the boat scraped the sides of the cave and seemed to become stuck.

As per everywhere else in Thailand very polite ladies who work for the national park service at the entry point and an absolute bargain for only 100 baht per person.
Interestingly the official trek starts at the first signposted waterfall however my favourite bit was a small waterfall / plunge pool which was about 5-10 minutes walk from the start point. From there you follow an established track and when you get to the official first level it becomes a very different terrain which would be challenging for anyone who isn‚Äôt steady on their feet! Lots of ‚Äònatural staircases‚Äô made out of tree roots and vines, certainly not navigable for anyone that struggles with hill climbs / mobility.

I‚Äôd recommend taking a big bottle of water as there‚Äôs nowhere to buy refreshments once you leave the entry point.

The first day was quite enjoyable. We saw many animals, and the day was exciting. Deaw seemed to be a good guide.

In the afternoon, we embarked on a ""night safari,"" which involved riding in the back of a car with a person who used a flashlight to point at trees, ostensibly to spot animals. However, the car moved quite quickly, making it doubtful how effective the flashlight was at such speeds. Then, it started raining heavily. I asked the staff to stop, but they did not. When the rain ceased and we started to enjoy the ""night safari"" again, we returned to the pickup point 15 minutes before the activity was scheduled to end. I wonder why...

On the morning of the second day, we discovered that Deaw had decided to start a tour with another group. It seemed he wanted to optimize his earnings and therefore assigned us another guide. Initially, we regretted not being with Deaw, as we had become familiar with him. However, we understood the situation and decided to give the new guide a chance.

The trek itself was enjoyable but lasted only about 1 hour and 30 minutes. The guide mentioned we were walking quite fast and had us lead the group instead of guiding us himself. By 12:00 PM, we had arrived at the central part of the park. We asked the guide about additional activities we could do until lunchtime, but he responded with, ""I don't know."" When we mentioned we had paid for a private tour and expected a private guide, he seemed surprised, asking, ""You paid me?!""

At that point, we learned that the guide would leave us, and we would spend the rest of the day on our own, receiving only transfers between locations. This was completely disappointing. We ended up doing activities we could have done independently by renting a motorcycle, without any guidance or explanations. Essentially, we visited several unremarkable waterfalls with no added value.

Deaw, when offering a private tour, there should be a minimum standard of service. Unfortunately, the second day fell short of our expectations. While we were satisfied with the first day of the tour, the second day was the opposite.

Additionally, one of the reasons we booked this tour was because of the activities listed on your website, many of which did not take place. It seems you cannot trust what the website advertises.

I understand that others might have enjoyed this tour, but the uncertainty of what Deaw feels like doing with your tour is not worth the price.

of the Mekong. The dam has diverted the Nam Phrong River. As water leaves its turbines, it empties into the Choen River. The dam is named after 
Princess Chulabhorn Walailak, of Thailand.  Chulabhorn dam, or formerly Nam Phrom dam, was built across the Nam Phrom River at an area known as Phu 
Yuak on the Khun Phai Mountain in Khon San district, Chaiyaphum province. Its reservoir is also a breeding source of fresh-water fish.  Typical to Thai dams, the Chulabhorn Dam is an earth core rockfill dam. Its function is to 
generate electricity and to irrigate riparian agriculture. The dam is 700 m (2,300 ft) long and 70 m (230 ft) high. Its reservoir covers 31 km2 (12 sq mi). The power house is located at the dam. The power house contains two turbines, each with a 
capacity of 20,000 KW. Total annual energy production is 59 Gwh.
Like the Pak Mun Dam downstream, the Chulabhorn has not been without its share of controversies.  These have principally been over the way in which 
water is allocated for irrigation vis-a-vis power generation; and over the diversion of water from the Nam Phong to the Choen River, depriving downstream 
communities along the Choen. Downstream of the Chulabhorn Dam, along the Choen River, lie three districts: Kaset Sombun, Ban Thaen and Phu Khieo. 
The reduced flows of the Choen has caused villagers to come together and try to persuade EGAT to increase the amount of water. This protest started 
in 1973, and has earned these villagers the title of the ""water beggars of the Northeast"".  Boat rentals are available to view the sights of the reservoir, and there are various attractions around the dam. lts lake-like reservoir provides 
beautiful scenery and surroundings. There are bungalows and restaurants in the area. There is a sightseeing point above the dam with the Temperate 
Plants Experimental Centre and observatory are also located there.
Tourist attractions within the Chulabhorn Dam are as follows:
The Replica of Phra Phutthasiri Sakkharat (Luangpho Chet Kasat) is a revered Buddha image enshrined at the left side of the upstream dam, opposite Chulabhorn Dam‚Äôs Park.
Chulabhorn Dam‚Äôs Parkcovers an area of approximately 41 rai, decorated as a preserved forest with various kinds of plants. There is also a Phrom Phitsamai pavilion for relaxation. The path through the park is paved with natural stones.
The 325-Million-Years Ancient Plants are in the similar category of grass, comprising two main species: namely, Son Sam Roi Yot (Lycopodium) and Son Hang Ma or Ya Thot Plong (Horsetail or Equisetum).
Lup Khuan View Pavilionis a viewpoint with a height of more than 800 metres.

The park may have been nice once but it is now a disgrace. It is neglected, untidy and in a poor state needing to be refurbished.
There is very little information and the fact that a few locals were benefitting from the deaths rather than promoting, rebuilding the charm and honouring the lives of those who tragically past. Also allowing people to see photo's of the unfortunate victims is beyond comprehensible.

Unfortunately, many of the more interesting pots and artifacts on display were previously looted so historians have little idea of where they were originally located. Near the museum is a replica of the main excavation site, which was heavily damaged by floods more than a decade ago.  The replica dig site is quite artificial.  Usual Thai two-tier pricing is practised here, which is one place I especially disapprove of since the location is designated a World Heritage Site and therefore ought to be equitably accessible to all; the site presumably also obtained financial support from UNESCO and international donors, so there is little justification for higher entry fees for foreign visitors.",Expecting more!,NONE,2022-05-31,3,Ban Chiang Museum,Nakhon Nayok,P03013984

2890,0,455348,en,940962567,"The park is a must if you are interested in the history of Thailand.  If you have seen Ayutthia then you must also see Sukhothai.  It predates Ayutthia and is historically important.  Although there has been much reconstruction, the main park is very interesting.  The park is divided into to three areas each with its own ticketing.  Most people only do the main park as it is the easiest to access.  
It is best to stay in accommodation in Old Sukhothai, as then it is just a walk to the park or you can hire a bicycle or buggy to get around.  It would be hot and difficult to walk around the park , especially after 9.00am. 

 We stayed in the History cafe which is an old wooden house run by a delightful old man but it was not the accommodation for us as it had steep steps and the bathroom facilities were inadequate.   It would suit younger people.  However there are more expensive  and suitable accommodations around.

Staying in New Sukhothai unless you had your own transport, is tedious with the long travel and additional expense.  

In old Sukhothai you walk or bike to the park  and hire an electric buggy 200B per hour (hire for two hours from the outset) from one of three sites outside the park.  The park also arranges tuk tuks and cute car buggies (not for large people).  The latter are squishy and more expensive than the more comfortable and larger buggies.  You are given a laminated map (better than the paper one given with the ticket).  The buggies have a place for your drink and you can leave bags (at your peril on busy days) in the buggy.  

 The ticket purchased from the ticket office is 100B per person (with thin paper map) and checked at the gate and at one other point in the park.  There are toilets and drink points within the park.  

You will spend a significant amount of the 1st hour at the Palace complex hence the need to hire for more than 1 hour at the outset.  If you hire only for 1 hour and more than 10 mins over the next hour on the return, you are charged for the next full hour.

The paths are easy to drive on and you park outside each site and walk on to the site.  Remember than you must obey the signs which tell you not to climb on the monuments.  

In some sites there are photographic records of the reconstruction that has been done.  Not restoration but reconstruction.

You have to bike or hire separate transport (tuk tuk (300B per hour)) to see the northern monuments.  It is a slow and awkward ride.  The tuk tuks are not made for Europeans and the ceilings are low, the side bench seats narrow and you have to watch your head getting in and our of the vehicle and can miss your footing on the small and narrow step.  More than three people in the tuk tuk and you have no where to put your legs!

Where the main park has some flowering plants, the other sites do not, and are very dry and dusty.

Getting to Sukhothai from Bangkok was done via Bangkok Airways and a van transfer 300B per person from the tiny airport.  The return journey on to Chiangmai was via Wintour (see separate review) buses.",How to see Sukhothai,Family,2024-02-29,5,Sukhothai Historical Park,Nakhon Nayok,P03013982

At the entrance will be taxis and rides up there. You can take your scooter or whatever you have and do the drive yourself. 

The road is pretty bad in many spots but not terrible. After roughly a kilometer there will be a bend in the road to the left and going straight is the decent to Nui beach. This is where I park my scooter. Take the bend left and it's about 500 meters a little uphill not too steep. You will come to a black rock that says Pa Hin Dum.

The opposite side of the road is another sign, in Thai, that has an arrow pointing up a trail. There is also a worn, faded very faded flag. Take this trail. It's about 200 meters and pretty built up with some railing and a rest spot at one point. Soon you will reach the top and see an incredible view.

Fair warning there is another trail behind a white bucket at the top. I went about 100 yards down this trail thinking it led to another view point. Well, I almost stepped on a snake and they have poisonous snakes. Luckily he darted away so that convinced me to go back to the main trail.",A must see.

Chang and Phaen are the leading male characters involved in a classical love triangle, competing for the hand of Wanthong.  Their 50 year struggle to win her hand involves abductions, revolts, court cases, trial by ordeal, jail and treachery and the poem is full of heroism, romance, sex, violence, custard-pie comedy, magic and horror.

In the end the king condemns Wanthong to death for failing to choose between the two men.

Every schoolchild in Thailand learns passages from the poem, and it is the source of many songs, popular sayings and metaphors.

The park is home to an enormous, giant tamarind tree, which according to local legend, is the tamarind tree mentioned in the poem, where Phaen is taught how to magically turn tamarind leaves into wasps.  There is a large notice alongside it declaring it to be one of the ""Trees of Thailand"" and is under Royal protection.",Side Attraction,Friends getaway,2017-10-31,4,Wat Khae,Nakhon Sawan,P03016125

There are two options, the klorng boats, which run from 5:30am to 10:30pm, with ticket prices around 8B to 20B. These hold about 40-50 passengers, have dubious safety equipment, unreliable timetables but zoom down the canal at breakneck speeds. Whilst they have plastic tarpaulins you are fairly low to the water and always face the possibility of getting wet from the spray.

The other alternative is the tourist hop on/hop off boats which run from Pratunam (bear the Central World Plaza) and Panfa Leelard, just behind the Mahakan Fort, at Phanfa Bridge. These are more expensive, but cheaper and quicker than a taxi, they give you the same experience as the local klorng boats but at a more leisurely and safer speed.

Don't expect the boat to pull gently up to the pier to allow people to embark or disembark. That's not its style. Instead, the kamikaze pilot at the helm zips along the canal at full throttle. At the last possible second, he throws the engine in reverse and careens into the pier. As the engine screams and fills the air with diesel smoke, passengers scramble on and off, desperately trying not to get crushed between the boat and the dock, or worse, fall into the canal. 

A kid wearing a crash helmet clambers around the outside of the boat, pulling himself along by a couple ropes while he sells tickets to the passengers who've hopped aboard. In the past, the deckhand didn't have to wear a helmet. But then the boat operators decided to get serious about safety. 

I decide to take the Khlong Saen Saep Express Boat out to Witthayu Road because unless you have a helicopter it's definitely the fastest way to get across town.

The water (by the raft) may not so clear (depend on the season and how busy it is on the day). But We found it pleasant  to swim and play in it for hours! 

The only down side is there are too many choices of the cafe/restaurant to go choose. So you feel overwhelmed.

Popular amongst bikers and tourists because of the amazing roads with stunning viewpoints.

I can't even tell how many times I did the loop, probably about 7+ times,and I would do it all over again. And again.
It's the feeling of freedom to wander where you want, on not such a strict schedule.

Is it dangerous, some ask.
Be responsible while driving, stay in your own lane and watch out for oncoming traffic, because sometimes they might be on your side of the road.
How about the curves?
Some of them are hairpin curves which can be quite steep.
How to know if you are able to ride such a curve?
As an example you could take a trip to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai. Just before arriving to the 300 steps stairs, there is a hairpin curve with some steepness to it. Now you can determine yourself if you are able to conquer this curve and the curves along the Mae Hong Son Loop.

When it comes to clockwise or counter clockwise direction, there is no right or wrong. However, I prefer clockwise because it seems in this direction the loop gets only better and better.
For this ride you might need 5/6 days. No rush, take it easy and enjoy every moment.

After a few days sightseeing in Chiang Mai, it's time to start the loop.
Make sure you have a (big) bike with at least 155cc.
My favourite ride is a Yamaha Aerox 155cc.
This is an automatic bike which has enough power to get you through the loop.
Leave some luggage behind in your Chiang Mai hotel if you have too much.
During the loop comfort is essential, so have a lightweight backpack on and leave some space for groceries on the way.
Always pack a raincoat (or 2, two bottles of water and a jacket. A jacket? Yes, it can be cold up there in the mountains!

Leave Chiang Mai City when it starts to get light outside. There is a long drive ahead. Follow road 108 for 63km and turn right into road 1009 to Doi Inthanon National Park. From road 1009 to the summit is about 50km.
This park is famous for it‚Äôs highest point of Thailand, waterfalls, the 2 pagoda‚Äôs and it‚Äôs garden. At the entrance of the national park you pay an entrance fee for yourself and your bike.
Personally I have 3 stops in this park. The first one is the Wachirathan Waterfall. This is 80m high waterfall and the biggest in this park.
The next stop are the 2 pagoda‚Äôs. It‚Äôs easy to miss while you drive, so keep your eyes open. You‚Äôll see some parkingspots on the left side of the road with a steep road between them, which is the entrance.
Park your bike and start walking up the steep road, or get the shuttle if available. The 2 pagoda‚Äôs honor the late king and queen of Thailand.
These pagoda‚Äôs are stunning, surrounded by a beautiful garden and amazing views if the weather is good.
Now the last stop is the highest point of Thailand, which is only 6km away from the pagoda‚Äôs. Now the anti climax is that the highest point of Thailand is surrounded by trees, so not much of a view.
Some people like to arrange accomodation in or near the park to enjoy the sunrise which they view from a once of the turns or from the pagoda‚Äôs.
It‚Äôs time to hit the road and leave the National Park.
Going back to road 108 and follow this road for 135km to Mae Sariang.
Mae Sariang is a city not far from Myanmar.
There is not much to see in this city, but rest is needed since the drive was about 290km in total.
A recommended hotel is Above The Sea Boutique hotel. There is not much
choice when it comes to hotels, but this is the best one. It has rooms in loft style and one of the softest beds I‚Äôve ever tried.
Drop your stuff in the room, have a shower and go for a Khao Soi,
a famous soup in the northern part of Thailand.
After a ride like today and a nice meal, you sure need a good rest.

The second day of the loop is also recommended to leave after breakfast,
Above The Sea Boutique Hotel offers you different options of breakfast.
The drive will be continued on road 108 for 165km to Mae Hong Son.
This doesn‚Äôt seem far, but there are many curves tob e conquered.
From Mae Sariang to Mae Hong Son you will see some changes in nature
and here and there some viewpoints will popup.
Get off your bike, grab a drink and enjoy some of the views you see a long the way. Have a stop at these viewpoints such as Mae La Luang Viewpoint with it‚Äôs soft rounded hills or Pha Bong Viewpoint with it‚Äôs view of huge mountains.
After 165km you arrive in Mae Hong Son City.
My recommended hotel is B2 Mae Hong Son Premier Resort.
This hotel is not far away from the center, but it‚Äôs located at a quiet spot.
It‚Äôs a good idea to stay here for 2 nights.
Wake up early the next day, very early. Grab the bike, buy some coffee and a bite at 7-11 and hit road 1095 for about 15km, where you then turn left into road 4001 for 25km until you arrive at the Pang Oung Lake. This is a beautiful lake, which is a project of the late King Bhumibol to restore forests and ecosystems. And if you are early enough, you can see the fog floating on the water. Sit down and enjoy the view with your breakfast you bought at 7-11.
Continue on road 4001 for 13km and you will arrive at Ban Rak Thai.
This is a village not far from the Myanmar border built in Yunnanese style.
In the middle of the village there is a lake, which also has the morning fog
over the water. You may want to choose where you want to enjoy the
morning fog, in Pang Oung Lake or Ban Rak Thai.
It‚Äôs only viewable in the morning for a short period of time.
By the time you arrive at the second destination, there won‚Äôt be morning fog to be seen anymore.
Be careful, because the road to these 2 destinations is very steep and has a
lot of curves.
From Ban Rak Thai on road 4001 going back for 28km, going back on road 1095 (which becomes road 108) for 20km, you arrive at a temple on a mountain called Wat Phra That Doi Kongmu.
This temple shows you a great view of the city of Mae Hong Son.
You can even see the airport from here.
There is a coffeeshop located next to the temple, have a seat, have a drink and enjoy the view.
When you‚Äôre on the way back to the hotel, stop by the Cafe Station or MHS Chamber of Commerce. At both of these places you‚Äôll be able to get yourself a certificate for doing the Mae Hong Son Loop. A very nice souvenir!
After you have returned in your hotel and enjoyed a nice shower,
it is recommended to get out in the evening and visit the lake in the city center, named Chong Kham.
This lake is surrounded by a temple, named Wat Chong Kham and a night market. Time for a nice dinner next to the lake with a view of the temple.
After such a day full of activities, it‚Äôs time to hit the sheets.

The next day awaits a trip to the city of Pai. Follow road 108/1095 for 105km.
This route has countless curves. Be careful, but enjoy it!
You will pass a bamboo bridge named Su Tong Pae Bridge after 12km on the road. This bridge is meant for monks, so they wouldn‚Äôt have to walk in the rice fields. After 10km on the road you will arrive at the fish cave, named Tham Pla.
Personally I am not into caves so I rather move on.
Along the way on road 1095 you arrive at the Pang Mapha viewpoint.
Beautiful view, if the weather allows it, and some stalls around for a drink and
a small bite. From this viewpoint it‚Äôs about 10km on road 1095 turning into 1226 going to Ban Jabo, if you are interested.
This is a Lahu tribe village with some beautiful views.
Another viewpoint along the main road is Doi Kiew Lom Viewpoint.
This is the viewpoint which has a view from both sides of the road,
there is a giant swing and ofcourse some stalls around for your appetite.
So after in total 105km you arrive in Pai. It will probably be late in the afternoon.
My recommended hotel in Pai is the Ai Pai Hotel.
It‚Äôs one of the most expensive hotels in Pai, but has amazing beds and is
around the corner of the famous walking street.
It‚Äôs recommended to stay for 2 nights, so you have a whole day to spend
in Pai.
Have a refreshing shower and head into the walking street. From the Ai Pai Hotel it‚Äôs less than 30 seconds and you‚Äôll be in the walking street.
There is a very laid back vibe and so much to see..and eat.
The next morning it‚Äôs time to grab the bike and drive 5km on road 1095 and head out to the Big White Buddha. Park your bike and have a morning workout walking up the stairs to the Buddha. Don‚Äôt forget a bottle of water, you‚Äôll need it! Once up there, you‚Äôll have a view of the city, if there isn‚Äôt too much fog.
4km away on road 1095 and you arrive at the Pai Canyon.
Park your bike next to the road and have a walk up Pai Canyon.
It has some beautiful views, but try not to be there midday, because it can be hot. Some people like to enjoy the sunset at that spot.
There is also another good spot to enjoy the sunset while having a bite and a drink, which is Two Huts Pai. From the White Buddha it‚Äôs only 6km away.
After sunset the walking street is waiting for the evening meal.

The next day is the last day of the Mae Hong Son Loop.The route goes on road 1095/107 from Pai back to Chiang Mai.
Don‚Äôt forget to take a picture or selfie at the ‚ÄúI AM PAI‚Äù sign.
You‚Äôll pass the Pai Canyon again on the way back, and just after the Pai Canyon you will see the Tha Pai Memorial Bridge. In the past this bridge was used to bring trees from the jungle to Pai.
In 1944 the Japanese Army burned down the bridge and at the end of the war it was rebuilt.
Along the curvy road you will pass a viewpoint named Rak Chang.
Not much of a view, but there is a coffeeshop, and you might need a refreshment during conquering this road.
60km away from Chiang Mai there is a small waterfall named Mok Fa.
It‚Äôs not too big, but it‚Äôs on the road to our destination, so why not.
Back on the road you will notice that traffic increases, trafficjams, shoppingmalls, noise, tourists‚Ä¶and after about 700km, 5 nights and 6 days you‚Äôre back in Chiang Mai.

Now this is just an example how to do the Mae Hong Son Loop.
You could do it counter clockwise, stay for more or less nights, have more or less stops; it‚Äôs all up to you.
One thing is guaranteed when you do this loop, you‚Äôll experience freedom and Thai hospitality.
Oh, and don‚Äôt forget wear a helmet!

The scenic route takes you through stunning mountain landscapes, quaint villages, and picturesque temples. As you wind your way through the lush greenery, you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the natural beauty that surrounds you.

One of the highlights of the trip is the opportunity to visit local hill tribes and learn about their culture and way of life. The people are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and it's a great chance to gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Thailand.

The roads themselves are a bit challenging at times, with steep inclines and hairpin turns, but they're well worth the effort. The feeling of freedom and exhilaration as you navigate the winding roads is indescribable.

Along the way, there are plenty of places to stop and take in the stunning views, enjoy a delicious meal, or relax at a hot spring. Each stop offers its own unique charm, and it's hard to pick a favorite.

Overall, riding the Mae Hong Son Loop is an incredible adventure that should be on every traveler's bucket list. It's an opportunity to experience the beauty and culture of Thailand in a way that few other experiences can match. Highly recommended!

Highlights: 
- Mae Sariang Town Lunch - Barbequed Buffalo meat, Herb filled fish and sticky rice
- Ban Jabo Village Noodle Shop - Noodle Shop with the best mountain view in the world

3108,0,1368429,en,883879115,"As a keen biker, I was excited to experience the breathtaking scenery of northern Thailand while negotiating one of the best and most challenging road routes in the world. 
Research suggested that going during burning season should be done with a face mask, and that some of the more spectacular views would be somewhat obscured. But none of those blogs explicitly stated not to do the loop during burning season. So I rented a Honda PCX 160 and planned to do the tour over 4 days

Inexperienced bikers should do the route clockwise which starts off less challenging and then builds in difficulty as you go
Take the opportunity to visit Thailands highest point at Doi Inthanon (they charge to enter the national park area)
If you want to pootle along and don‚Äôt care about enjoying the thrilling ride that the roads can offer, you can get away with renting a 125cc. If (like me) you are a biker, you‚Äôll need a minimum of 155cc underneath you. 
Unless you are massively resilient, 4 days is the minimum you should spend riding the loop.
Getting stuck behind the inconsistent and unobservant Thai drivers in pick-ups and minibuses is massively frustrating. 
The large scale land-burning destroys the entire experience. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, anger-inducing and upsetting seeing nature, the landscape and the environment all being destroyed and there is obviously no wildlife to see aside from small groups of semi-domesticated cattle.
Even if you wear a surgical grade mask 24/7 the smoke will still get into your lungs and affect your respiratory system.
The burning really heats up the area with the hot earth from below and the greenhouse effect of the thick smoke.
Fill up with petrol regularly, especially if riding a smaller bike.
Do not miss the Lod caves; Absolutely mind blowing. 
Some of the waterfalls are nice to see, and there‚Äôs a brilliant bamboo bridge and temple complex just north of Mae Hong Son city. 
On the way back into Chiang Mai (from the north), you can have a coffee in an Airbus A330 (Air Diamond cafe)

All in all, the Mae Hong Son loops has the potential to be a world-class experience for lovers of 2 wheel machinery, but you have to catch it during the relatively small window when the weather is dry and the locals aren‚Äôt unceremoniously scorching the earth. Going back to do it on a ‚Äòproper‚Äô bike (multistrada or similar) is now on my bucket list.",Do not go during burning season!,Couples,2023-03-31,3,Mae Hong Son Loop,Nakhon Sawan,P03016134

If you're in Chiang Mai, I highly recommend doing the loop; the scenery, the stops, the ride, it's breathtaking! 

I spent one night in Doi Inthanon at KowitFarmStay - 10/10. If nature is your thing and you want something special, head over here! Absolute bliss.

I spent 2 nights in Mae Hong Son City, the journey was 4 hours long but it was incredible. 

I spent 2 nights in Pai, a little hippy town mostly consisting of Europeans. It's a quirky little place, nice to relax and chill.
I stayed at The Nest House - 10/10 again! Absolutely lovely place, you can chill on the balcony in the hammock or head into town which is a 5min walk.

The attractive lake apparently (now an important reservoir) began as a small pond and there had been many disputes over the water necessary for agriculture, particularly the tea plantations. To resolve the problem the previous King, Rama 9, created the extensive modern day reservoir, solving the water shortages and also having the side effect of establishing a popular tourist resort with several thousand rooms as well as a clutch of unsightly camping sites.

Once in the National Park, you can arrange a boat trip around the Lake. There are two possibilities: hire a boat for a private tour or join others in a boat which will be cheaper.

As I was walking I was approached by a friendly person who spoke English well.   He told me he worked for the government and that the government has one day left for providing Tuk Tuk driver‚Äôs free gas.   The government would pay Tuk Tuk drivers that worked for the government free gas for tourism purposes.   
The ‚Äúgovernment worker‚Äù called a government subsidized Tuk Tuk driver for me and gave me a copy of the city map with different sites to see.  He explained the driver of the Tuk Tuk would bring me around to different sites and stay with me for $40 Baht.   The driver would bring me to different temples to see and would bring me to get something to eat and go shopping at the ‚ÄúFactory.‚Äù
The driver did bring me to different temples; however most of the temples were not open.   I did request for him to take me to get an early lunch which the driver did.   Upon asking to see a temple that was open the driver instead took me to the ‚ÄúFactory‚Äù for shopping.   I asked the driver why he took me there and he said because it was now open.   I entered the shop which later I found out the ‚ÄúFactory‚Äù has only one shop which I entered.   The Tailor shop had suits and other clothing for sale.   
I met with an English speaking sales person.   He showed me Armani Suits and stated that I could have two suits, three pants, four ties and three shirts for $32500 Baht.   I felt the quality of the fabric and he stated it was a wool and cashmere blend.   I told him that I would be leaving within three days to go to Koi Samui and would need to have the suits made right away.   He stated they make them in the shop and would be ready the next day.   I accepted the offer and paid $32500 Baht.   Realizing after I signed that it was ‚Äúno refund.‚Äù   They took my measurements and setup a fitting the next day.  After the Tuk Tuk driver dropped me off where he picked me up, he didn‚Äôt even ask for the $40 Baht which I thought was odd.
The next day I left my hotel for a fitting at the shop.   I met with the tailor who brought in pieces of clothing.  I asked why the suits, pants and shirts were not ready.   He stated it would take four weeks to make.   I told the tailor that is not what we agreed on.   I tried on the pants, a shirt which were the same patterns I chose the day before and did not fit properly.   He took measurements.  He then put on a jacket with no sleeves and pulled up the sleeve to make a measurement.  He then took a picture of me with the pulled up sleeve.   I also noticed they did not feel soft as they did yesterday but rather like polyester.   
I asked the tailor what the materials were for the suits, pants and shirts.   He stated it was cashmere.  The tailor stated the shirt was made of Egyptian cotton.   I told him that was not what we agreed upon.  We agreed upon wool and cashmere blend.  I explained that cashmere was too soft to hold up properly in a suit.   I also explained that the suit and shirt material was not the same as yesterday and felt like polyester.   He explained it was cashmere and cotton.  I then immediately told him that I wanted a refund.   He explained I signed and paid for the clothing with no refunds.   
After I left the shop, I felt like this was a ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù and a scam.   I looked up the name of the shop, ‚ÄúDusitta Collection‚Äù and found out it was a scam on the Internet.

We just got back to our hotel after ordering the clothing about 12 days ago (we leave tomorrow) and our items were delivered as promised on the day promised, with very nice bags with nice wooden hangers. They added in a pashmina for me and two ties, pocket squares, and cuff links for my husband which they said they would. Every single item fits both of us perfectly. I have absolutely no regrets or complaints! I‚Äôm not sure how the tailor gets such bad reviews if everyone gets this quality, but we did not receive anything poorly fitted or made.

3219,0,553572,en,868962457,"To be clear, I think that this should have been a five star experience, and I rated it as such.  But I will admit that doing it the second day that you‚Äôre in Bangkok when you‚Äôre still jet lagged and don‚Äôt know your way around and have limited stamina might not have been the best plan.

We were advised to book a hop on, hop off boat for the day.  It was not a bad plan, and at 140 or 150 BHT per person, it wasn‚Äôt that expensive, but I think that one way tickets were 30 BHT per ride, and unless you are very disciplined and fast, you are not likely to be able to tour five different stops in a day.  As it was, we decided that we would go from the beginning of the boat dock to the terminus, then decide which stops we wanted to get off at on the way back.  We spent way too much time wandering the last stop, which really did not have a lot to see, but took a lot of time to figure that out.  So by the time we got around to seeing the Wat Arun and Wat Pho stops (same stop, but you need to take a 10 BHT ferry ride from Wat Arun to get across the river to Wat Pho), it was mid afternoon, and by the time we had seen both stops, we discovered that we had missed the last boat pick up to return.

this sanctuary really deserves world heritage status.

3275,35,454890,en,253170519,"We took a leap of faith and visited Huai Kha Kaeng instead of one of the more famous Thai parks. We were not disappointed. However, we do have some pointers to manage the expectations of future visitors.

What to expect? This is still real wilderness, meaning: only camping facilities in the park, a very limited number of trails and only two view towers. Your wildlife viewing will mostly be done from the car or from one of the towers. Patience is key while you wait for something interesting to come out in the open. Therefore, we do not recommend this park for families with small kids (unless they like sitting still). We do recommend this park for real wildlife enthusiasts because in the three days we were there we saw plenty of wildlife (wild boar, several kinds of deer, gibbons, bats, banteng, civets, more birds than we can count, muntjak, jackals, ...). This park also gives you a very teeny tiny chance to see a tiger (we didn't though).
The wildlife is quite shy, once an animal spots you, it will show you immediately how fast it can run. If you want to take photos, a 300mm lens is a minimum for good shots.

How to get there? The area is quite remote and unless you feel like doing a bus hopping tour, get a guide who provides you with transportation.

Why take a guide and who to take? You will enjoy this park much more if you have someone with you to show you animals. Not many guides operate in this park but we were very happy with Tontan Travels. Doesn't matter what you see or hear, our guide Tony was able to find it and identify it. If we hadn't had him with us, we would have seen only a fraction of the animals we actually saw now. Also ask your guide for an after dark walk to see palm civets, wild boars, tokays, ... .

Where to stay and eat? You can stay outside the park but we thought the bungalows there were of poor value. Camping inside the camp is much more fun and gives you the opportunity to get up early to see animals. The ablution blocks were clean and quite ok when we were there (do not expect a warm shower). Just outside the park there is a little restaurant. We found the food average but it is your only option and you won't go hungry.

What to bring? your camera with telelens for the viewing towers and long pants for jungle walks. Ask your guide for leech socks, in the dry season you won't see leeches but there will be ticks and the socks will make it more difficult for them.

In a nutshell: if you enjoy spotting wildlife and don't mind being patient to see it...go to this park with a good guide and cross your fingers to see a tiger!",A piece of wild Thailand,Couples,2015-02-28,4,Thungyai - Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuaries,Uthai Thani,P03012832

3346,1,1315376,en,952784154,"TRIP REPORT ‚Äì MV EXPLORER FROM SEA DRAGON DIVE CENTER

After my dive buddy and I decided to do another liveaboard trip, I was tasked with doing the research on destinations and trip length.  Given that it was somewhat of a last-minute commitment, there were some limitations in availability in regions that neither of us had previously done.  Thailand eventually topped the list.
Our location on the west coast of Canada meant that a Thailand trip would involve long flights so more bang for the buck would be achieved by a ten-to-fourteen-day liveaboard itinerary.  Although there were about three liveaboards that offered longer itineraries, only Sea Dragon‚Äôs MV Explorer had available space on their 13-day trip.  This trip is actually a combination of their 5, 3 and 5 day trips but, in spite of that, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of duplication in dives site and those that were such as Richelieu Rock were very deserving of multiple visits.  The one downside of the combined trips was that the final day of each segment only offer 2 dives before heading to a northern fishing village to offload departing guests and await the arrival of new ones.  That did, however, give you the opportunity to off-gas and to take advantage of inexpensive beer.
The Explorer is a 25 Meter (82 feet) wooden hulled ship that has been re-configured as a dive boat.  The Sea Dragon Dive Centre offers this and the steel hulled Andaman as liveaboards and both reflect very good value relative to other liveaboard operators.  They are, however, not as luxurious.  According to staff, the Andaman caters to a younger crowd who don‚Äôt mind the mostly dorm style accommodations and 20 divers instead of the 16 max on the Explorer.  The Explorer is slightly more expensive.
The ship‚Äôs layout is quite functional as a dive platform.  The dive deck is not really any tighter than other liveaboards I have been on, and crowding is minimized by only allowing one or two groups to gear up at a time.  They divide guests into groups of four plus a guide.  Sadly, all dives are from a RIB dingy since a high-ranking government official had a close call with a big boat upon surfacing a few years ago.  He issued an edict that there would be no jumping off the big boats any longer.  The boat staff are great in assisting divers on and off of the dingy.  Each dive station has a milk crate for gear.  There are several freshwater rinse hoses as well as a camera and computer rinse tank.  The camera table is quite small and, since it is also used by the cooks, your set-up will be gently moved out of the way when they need it.
The booking price does include a full set of dive gear.  From a glance, the dive gear appeared to be relatively current, name brand items that are well maintained by the staff.  Do be aware that the BCD‚Äôs are not weight integrated.  The bonus for guests using the boat‚Äôs gear is that, at the end of their trips, they leave it to the crew to clean, dry and put away.  If you bring your own gear (as we and a few divers did) you get a 10% discount off the price of the trip‚Ä¶but make sure you tell that to the diver centre staff when you are making the final payment.  They do provide, at no charge, weight belts or weights for integrated BCD‚Äôs, dive computers (Zoop), torches for night dives and not particularly good SMB‚Äôs.  Tanks are standard 12 Litre/Aluminum 80‚Äôs with DIN or Yoke available.  Larger 15 Litre tanks are available.  Guests gear up and head to the dingy when called and the boat crew will have already grabbed your fins to be put on when you are seated.
Everyone is different in terms of their need for thermal protection and that will vary depending on the time of year.  For me and for this trip in May, a 2-mil shorty was fine but be prepared for massive temperatures due to upswelling currents.  There were times when we felt like we had gone from a hot tub to an ice bath and the computer recorded temperatures as high as 87 down to 73 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The dive deck also has three washrooms with toilet, sink and shower for a quick change between dives.  The dive guide cabin is located on this deck as is the kitchen.  Past the kitchen are 6 ensuite guest cabins that accommodate two guests either in twin or double configurations.  They are very well air conditioned but, contrary to website claims, doesn‚Äôt really have ample storage space.  That is a very good reason to pack far less clothing as this is, after all, a dive boat and not a fashion show.  There are 220 Volt round pin power outlets for each bunk, good individual reading lights and a decent pillow and blanket.  The pads on the bunks did make me appreciate the hotel mattress and the Thai massage after the trip.  It is not an overly spacious cabin but not outrageously small either.  All of these cabins have a good size sea view window that could be used for an evacuation should the principal exit be blocked.  The combo toilet, sink and shower washroom is small but adequate.  The provided towel is not overly plush, and you may wish to bring your own for topside or the beach.  When booking you should be aware that these are the only cabins with ensuite washrooms.  The two double cabins on the middle deck do not have ensuites and do need to utilize the washrooms on the dive deck‚Ä¶.one deck down.  
The middle deck is the key area between dives.  It has a considerable amount of seating for meals and socializing along with coolers/freezers for drinks and ice cream treats.  Certain items such as beer, wine, coffee capsules and ice cream cost extra and are on an honor system for guests to record consumption.  Prices are more than reasonable.  All meals, buffet style, are served here and you will not go hungry.  The middle deck has some charging availability and a very large supply of clips for drying clothing on the rails along each side of the front deck right to the bow.  The two double cabins are on this deck.  This deck is where all the pre-dive briefings take place and the daily dive schedule (subject to change due to weather/current) is posted.  Each guest has an insulated drink container (with identifying letters) to borrow although many bring their own.
I will say that my dive buddy and I, in addition to liking the great boat staff and dive guides, had a great connection to John Carter‚Ä¶. our trip supervisor and our dive guide for the two five-day segments.
The upper deck would be considered a sundeck and has full length pads, hammocks and bean bag chairs and is partially covered as well as open for sunseekers.  It does get hot up top.
THE GOOD
‚Ä¢	Very good value‚Ä¶not the Hilton but above a Motel 6
‚Ä¢	Exceptionally delicious and plentiful food‚Ä¶both Thai and Western with consideration to vegetarians upon request.  You would be hard pressed to find better on any boat.  The routine was usually: briefing, dive, eat and surface interval.  Repeat three and four times daily.
‚Ä¢	An incredibly hard working and delightful boat crew and dive guides.  I have only done about 10 liveaboards and have had equal but never better crews and guides.  We especially enjoyed John and Nat who were our guides.
‚Ä¢	We also had the pleasure of having two dive master‚Äôs in training who accompanied us on all dives and did guide some of them.
‚Ä¢	Small dive groups and a strategy to be woken up early so as to have a quick briefing and to get in the water earlier than the other big boats.  Once we have done that, then the food and surface intervals for us and the other boats generally kept us well apart.
‚Ä¢	Extra charges for Nitrox were reasonable as were the treat and beverages that required payment.
‚Ä¢	Dive groups organized based on experience.
‚Ä¢	A nice assortment of guests from various ends of the earth.
‚Ä¢	Dive guides who cater to guest requests when it comes to finding marine life.
‚Ä¢	Dive boat supervisors who offered exceptional communication throughout the trips.
‚Ä¢	Some world class dive sites‚Ä¶especially Richelieu Rock that was full of massive schools of fish and lots of pelagic predators.
‚Ä¢	Sea Dragon Dive Center itself as they were reliable in advance communications and took care of things like arranging reasonably priced taxis to and from the dive center or recommending hotels. 
‚Ä¢	The recommended tip level is more than reasonable and more than deserved.
‚Ä¢	A skilled and experienced Captain.

THE NOT SO GOOD
‚Ä¢	Somewhat smallish sleeping quarters.
‚Ä¢	Cabin mattresses that were not overly kind to your back.
‚Ä¢	Smallish camera table compared to other boats
‚Ä¢	No Nitrox analyzers available to guests.  Instead, a staff member would sample one tank and declare the percentage for everyone diving Nitrox.  The boat should invest in a couple of analyzers for the guests to do their own testing to sign off.  This is how nitrox divers were taught during their course.
‚Ä¢	The SMBs for the guests are pretty basic and do not include a reel.  You may wish to bring your own.
‚Ä¢	Although they provide torches for night dives and the guide carries one back-up, any further fails would end the dive.  Bring your own as a back-up.
‚Ä¢	Not exceptional visibility.  Probably 50 feet tops.  That may have been a product of the time of year.
‚Ä¢	The limit of two dives on the transition days.
‚Ä¢	Not seeing mantas or whale sharks.  Certainly not the fault of the boat or the crew and likely the time of the year.  We did make up for it by finding a large Bull Shark on one dive.

We are relatively fit and have hiked before and it took us 2 hours each way- the path, once you find the starting point, is relatively easy to follow, crossing the river many times! 

(I am unaware if there are other routes) We started from Wonderland camping site- this for some reason does not come up on google maps app but does come up when you search google maps online and hired a moped to get there from Pai town.

The Northern Thailand landscapes are unparalleled.

I've heard some people complain about the price - it's really not bad cmon! Yes, locals have a lower price - but that reflects the salary ratio of what local Thais make. 

20 baht for locals (75 cents in US) vs. 200 baht for foreigners (around 6 USD). Like seriously?? Are you really going to complain about 6 dollars? the average monthly salary for an avg worker in Lampang is around 15,000 baht (500 dollars) so yeah, they are going to have a cheaper price. I know this because I lived in Lampang. Don't complain! 

THE thing to do in Chae Son is to boil eggs in the hot springs. It's an ""only in Thailand"" experience. Something about the temperature or the minerals makes the eggs boil from the inside out. So if you boil for 15 minutes, you will get an egg that has a soft-boiled yolk and a gelatinous (but cooked) egg white. It slides right out of the shell. Eat with soy sauce.

The golden Chedi is located in a separate area, and it is surrounded by stalls where anyone can buy Buddha images, candals, ""phuang ma lai"" to pay respect to Buddha. The Chedi is very tall and large and outside there is a small temple house with a huge golden Buddha inside. The area of this complex is very large so there are some stalls selling foods and beverages at the entrance road. In a central point there is a huge tree (where I relaxed for a while...) that is surrounded by sculptures of Buddha in different positions and other Buddhism beings.

Aside from that history it is a very pretty wooden temple which is also the villages community center so you will see on any given day a slice of rural northern Thai culture going on at the temple also being located in a farming community where still to this day many of the fields are still planted and cultivated by hand offering a great photo opportunity so see the hand harvesting of rice fields by local families.

This is a house museum with 5 levels and the collections of over 1000 pieces. The pictures here are just on the ground floor where photography allows, what upstairs are mind blowing. In fact, the museum is frequently visited by the Thai royal family, some of the pieces have been purchased by them and now display in the palace. 

I had a previllage to have a long conversation with Kun Charoui, the owner. Maintaining a wood carving museum is extremely hard work, spiders, ants and many insects love to nest in the empty spaces inside the carving, some are very difficult to clean, so dusting abd cleaning is a full time job here.

Kun Charoui employs all his workers from disadvantage backgrounds. Unfortunately, as a result, the guild doesn't speak English and does not have enough experience and expertise to sufficiently curate the museum in my opinion. 

If you want English tour, please contact the museum before you go, hopefully you will get Kun Charoui  to show you around. Meeting him will leave a lasting impression on you. He is one of a kind, just like his collection.

Nevertheless, if you are in town, you might want to stop by Wat Trai Phum and see this locally famous statue. There is a somewhat intriguing local legend that goes along with it at least.

The Phra Buddha Maha Thammaraja statue dates back to the Khmer era and it is probably of Khmer not Thai origin. Its early history is cloaked in mystery but it ended up at Wat Trai Phum, a minor wat which was founded in 1557. (None of the buildings at the site today seem to be more than about 100 years old, however). The statue made a real nuisance of itself by wandering out of the wat one night and bathing itself in the cool waters of the Pa Sak River, which is located just across the road from the temple. The locals brought it back to the temple but they now have an annual festivity in which the gilded idol is immersed once more in the waters of the Pa Sok River every year. 

The venerated image is perhaps more likely to appeal to Thais than foreigners. (Yet there was no Thais viewing it during our visit either).

This made me uncomfortable as I could not be sure that the tickets would be honoured and there was no way to contact Wintour for conformation.  Also there is no indication of where the Wintour bus will stop in Old Sukhothai for the onward journey to Chiang Mai.  The bus stop is at the end of the old town opposite a tiny wat  and the Abandon Koff Cafe.  It is on the side of the road that is going to New Sukhothai.  Passengers are led across the road by a staff member holding a red flag to stop traffic!  You must exchange your paper ticket from the third party for a confirmed ticket from the Old Sukhothai office (preferably done at least the day before).  You will be asked to find your name on the seats indicated on the computer screen.  If it is not there, the lady will ring the office at the New Sukhothai bus station and your seat will then be confirmed and you will be given new tickets.  There are some seats and a toilet (western style but no toilet paper) at the office.

The buses to Chiang Mai leave at 9.50am (9.30 from New Sukhothai) and 10.50 from Old Sukhothai.  Prior to ascending the steep stairs to the upper level you are given a drink, cake and bottle of water.  If you have booked early enough (bookings open 30 days before departure) you may be lucky to get the front seats which have ample leg room but your view through the dirty windows may be partly obscured by an old non functioning tv screen.  The buses are certainly not new or VIP.  The seats are reasonably comfortable.  Our bus did stop a number of times to let passengers on or off at unscheduled places and although it did stop at a bus station, we have no idea of which one as there was no sign and the bus did not stop for more than a couple of minutes (driver toilet stop).  We did not use the on board toilet down stairs as going up and down the steep stairs would have been hazardous on a moving vehicle.

The seating is two x two.  The bus stops at Terminal two in Chiang Mai and you will need to go to Terminal Three (across the road) if you are purchasing Green bus tickets or any other tickets.   The bus is met by crowds of tuck tuk drivers and hotel touts.  Get a Grab or Bolt if you are not comfortable negotiating a fair price for your travel to your accommodation.  

If you are well heeled then it would be better to hire a private car and driver for the journey rather than using Wintour.",Wintour - no option,Family,2024-03-31,3,Sukhothai Wintour,Sukhothai,P03002049

The price is reasonable, at 324TB and includes a small snack and drink.  It is best to book 1 day in advance, as the Friday I took the bus to Chiang Mai, the bus was very full, mainly with foreigners.
The main drawback is the lack of reliable arrival time.  I had see an estimated arrival time of 1:30pm, and told my tour company to call and confirm, as they were meeting me at the bus terminal.  Instead, we did not arrive until 3:30pm, or 2 hours later.
If I had known, I would have cancelled the 1/2 day tour; as it was, I still had time to visit the Wats, etc. as they close at 6:00-6:30pm.  But everything felt rushed.

To go to Sukhothai this is pretty much your option (train requires acrobatics and you still end up on a bus at the end to get into Sukhothai anyway). Bus was airconditioned, they provide water and snacks which was nice, but we also hoarded our own bus snacks (recommended). They also did a stop about halfway where we could get off, use the toilet (there's also a toilet on board) and buy more snacks if we wanted.

At BLES, visitors spend their days out in the forest watching the elephants graze and interact with each other.  I always enjoy the delicious, vegan food served there. Lodging was provided at a quiet, comfortable homestay less than 10 minutes away. Despite the language barrier, staff is so welcoming and kind.

Pancake! 
What a special time I had and I will always cherish my time at BLES. 
The welcome guests receive is so warm and friendly. 
But the reason I went to BLES, was to see elephants. I have been a supporter of BLES for years but hadn‚Äôt been able to visit until this year. Finally, I made my booking and was able to get to Thailand after three attempts. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!  
BLES is a 100% true ETHICAL Elephant Sanctuary. 
No riding, no bathing, no feeding, no chains and NO bullhooks.  All the elephants have been rescued from very sad places and now live in the best place at BLES. They have many acres set in the forest where they browse on their natural, lush, green foliage.  They bathe in mud holes and running waterways. Every day is a new adventure as they choose where they want to roam. The elephants have their own groups of friends they stick close with. They play and vocalize together, and are a family herd‚Ä¶ just like they were born to be in the wild. They heal both physically and emotionally here at BLES. 

As a visitor‚Ä¶ a guest of BLES‚Ä¶ only 6-10 people are permitted at a time to keep the human aspect at a minimum. The elephants come first so keeping their world ‚Äútheirs‚Äù is priority. You will fall in love with the absolute tranquility of observing them as they spend their day doing what elephants do!  Every day brings new adventures and the wonders of these gentle giants!  
A Picnic in the forest is the perfect lunch served to you while you sit and watch these magnificent elephants. Not to mention, the food is delicious!  You may even get a personal special visitor if you are lucky!  
Your accommodations are only 10 minutes away in a cute air conditioned hotel up the road from the sanctuary. 

You‚Äôll help cut up some fruit and make sticky rice balls for Nwon. You‚Äôll watch Katherine tend to the ‚ÄúGossip Girls‚Äù feet where she maintains them to help them stay healthy. All on elephant time‚Ä¶ they are never forced, only encouraged with special treats. 

The COFFEE on my last day that the mahouts made was FABULOUS!  The picnics, the food!  And especially all of the stories. 
I believe BLES is the most perfect place for these special elephants to have as their home. A place that is the closest they can be to being wild. BLES must continue to be able to provide more elephants this beautiful life. 
Your support is greatly appreciated and helps tremendously with the ongoing care of all the elephants and the rescue of new elephants in desperate need of sanctuary. 
Make your reservation now‚Ä¶ you will be glad you did because there is nothing like this in Thailand but BLES

Something so many elephants are not allowed to do and some of them will never get the chance to have a life like this. The mahouts take such a good care of the elephants. It amazes me every time to see how they put their trust in their mahout, in the strong bond they have created troughout the years. The housekeepers make the most delicious food. One of the highligths of the day was going out with the truck and the staff to go collect banana trees for the elephants. The scenery is so beautiful. And everyone is so kind.

The elephants are beautiful, and watching them roam through nature, happy and truly free to do as they please, was inspiring and fascinating.

It's truly astonishing to contemplate how ancient people managed to construct such a massive city. The entire district spans approximately 866 hectares, which leaves us even more impressed.

The site was notably surveyed by Prince Damrong Raanubhab in 1904, who had found historical references to the town, which had been abandoned and reclaimed by vegetation. There are not many ruins remaining, but those which do exist are quite interesting. Prang Song Phi Nong and Prang Si Thep date to the 11th and 12th centuries. 

Most interesting for me were laterite and brick monuments that date back to the 8th century.

On top of the laterite base are the remains of what was once a huge brick stupa (now collapsed into a pile of brick rubble).

Also administered by the Si Thep Historical Park is Tamorat Cave, which reportedly contains some fabulous ancient stone carvings.

Phimai is a triple walled buddhist sanctuary that was regularly maintained and repaired, for which we have to be thankful. The outer courts are largely in ruin and there is not much to see.

It is located in the town of Phimai, Nakhon Ratchasima province. It is one of the most important tourist attractions in the province.

Most buildings are from the late 11th to the late 12th century, built in the Baphuon, Bayon and Khmer temple style. However, even though the Khmer at that time were Hindu, the temple was built as a Buddhist temple, since the inhabitants of the Khorat area had been Buddhists as far back as the 7th century. 

Didn't know a whole lot about this place before I arrived so was pleasantly surprised when I had the chance to see some real history in Korat. Entrance was a very reasonable 1 Euros 23 cents, a bargain, considering I spent well over two hours here, wandering around the ruins and taking in all the breathtaking temples, monuments, and ruins. 

There were not so many tourists as well, a few, but as the place is big enough everyone is well spaced out, which is great for taking some photos and for taking your time walking around.
There is plenty of areas for one to sit down and take a break, under a tree in out of the sun, or for a close up at the stone work involved in the building of the ruins.

The gardens and lawns, and the ruins themselves, are very well maintained and looked after, and there are toilets and bathrooms available, and a mini museum for people to learn more about the Khmer history of the area.

Go early and ensure you have a way back, you can even ask ur grab, tuk tuk or bolt to return later.

A monk was also having the same issue as us so we gave him a lift to Hua Hin temple too! All and all a fantastic experience!! Even the issues made it even better of an experience for us.

We walked to the beach which was a distance of about three and a half kilometres from our Hotel, BlueSotel Smart. 

This beach is definitely less commercialised and quieter than its neighbour, Ao Nang Beach. There was a distinct lack of tourists here during the day. 

It stretches along the coast for about three kilometres and comprises of a mixture of white sand and small seashells which creates patches in the sand that looks pink. 

It has three small island at one end Ko Liao, Ko Khao Sam Nuai, no name for the third one. At the other end the Do Do River (Haeng) flows into the sea.
The water's of the Andaman Sea are very shallow here, walk into the a good distance and still only knee deep. 

At low tide the long-tailed boats, at the far end of the beach, get stranded on the sand until the tide comes back. 

There are no facilities on the beach, no sunbeds or umbrellas, the only shade provided is by the trees that are along the back of the beach. 

We did spend a good number of hours on our beach towels in the shade provided by the trees.

Along the main street at the back of the beach is the Ao Nang Landmark Night Market. There are also a number of shops and food outlets were supplies can be bought for visiting the beach. 

Sadly a lot of litter, food cartons and drink related, gets dropped during the evening then makes it's way on to the beach. It would appear that the beach wall is used as seating and a table and the cartons dropped. As this beach is less commercialised beach cleaners are very infrequent visitors, also the tide does come in rather close to shore and washes it away. 

As the tide does come in rather close there is a coastal defence system comprising of stones and rocks fasten by wire which is along the beach wall. Not really attractive but necessary.

Stayed two nights camping at Ban Krang Campsite where we rented tents and gear. LOVELY and HELPFUL STAFF and hearty food at the small restaurant (closes late afternoon so stock up on instant noodles or get a rice dish ""to-go"" and keep it for dinner). When we went to bed in the evening there would be thousands of fireflies in the dark giving everything a magic touch, and in the morning we woke up listening to the song of the gibbons. What's not to like? One afternoon we saw a very peaceful little sunbear on the fringes of the campsite behind the kitchen, and at night porcupines could be seen when we spotlighted with a strong torch. Campsite itself also quite good for birding. We hired a GREAT GUIDE at the campsite one day and he was very knowledgeable and good at spotting birds and wildlife.

Also stayed two nights outside the park at the Baan Maka Nature Lodge which was also very good - to our family this gave the perfect mix so we could explore the park over several days without rouging it too much (and we saw a leopard cat ((Prionailurus bengalensis) when walking the nature trail at the lodge premises after dinner one evening).

We booked a car/driver and a birdwatching guide for two days for our tours into the park through TONTAN TRAVEL. That worked EXCELLENT. Very knowledgeable and hard-working guide striving to find interesting birds, reptiles and mammals for us. They took us all the way up to Phanoen Thung Campsite one day and the other day we primarily spent at the lower sections between the two campsites and between the park entry gate and the first camp-site. Tontan travel also helped is book transfers from Bangkok and futher south after our stay in the park and that also worked very smoothly.

This national park is great. Not many tourists when we were there and a good wilderness vibe. Most of it is dense jungle, so very difficult to spot mammals apart from the daytime-active squirrels and langurs/gibbons, and only very limited possibilities to do spotlighting after dark (only on campsite grounds hence have to sleep overnight at the campsites inside the park at least for part of the stay if spotlighting is of interest). Only one road leads into the park so you end up walking/driving quite a bit back and forth this route when optimizing chances for spotting birds and other wildlife. 

If you are a little bit serious about seeing birds and wildlife and experiencing a fascinating ecosystem I would highly recommend this park.",Great experience in Kaeng Krachan NP,NONE,2023-07-31,5,Kaeng Krachan National Park,Phitsanulok,P03012840

Our guide Mong spoke good English, was extremely knowledgeable about the wildlife and was tireless in looking out for animals to show us. All in all, very professional.  Mong also carried extra binoculars and a scope which was really handy for us amateurs and even reminded us about topping up on insect repellent! It was apparently a lean day for sightings (and I think I read that wet season generally is not great) but we were thrilled to watch families of gibbons and dusky leaf monkeys in the treetops, clouds of butterflies also spotted a mouse deer, water monitors and all manner of weird insects and birds including hornbills and eagles (I am not the birder in the family!). Mong also spotted recent panther prints.
The view from the second campsite at the top of the hills is stunning but be warned, the drive up is extremely bumpy.
A long, tiring day but for all the best reasons. Already planning our next trip.

29 December 2019 was the day we visited Phu Gin Rong National Park and the day we strike jackpot with Mother Nature. Not only did we see the magnificent sea mist at sunrise (although it wasn‚Äôt very dense, it was still breathtaking.), we caught the Thai Sakura in full bloom too! Due to weather change in Thailand, the blossom came early on 25 December 2019 instead of the Park‚Äôs estimated date. It was Day 4 of the blossom when we saw the gorgeous blossom. Thus, the hills were covered with lovely pink coat.

The waking up at 3am on 29 December 2019 was so rewarding and memorable for us!",Striking jackpot with Mother Nature,Family,2019-12-31,5,Phu Hin Rongka National Park,Phitsanulok,P03006668

If you're up to a short climb, you can take the stairs to the left and hike to a beautiful view point. Continue around the pathway, and you find the path leading up the mountain. This is a bit tougher of a hike, with steep climbs and some sharp rocks to navigate. There are two main view points high up on the mountain. Between the first and second view points is where you find the toughest footing, with the sharpest rocks. The second view point offers a stunning view of the rice fields, and farther off to the sea. Continue around the loop and you end up back at the starting point. 

Most of the trail is shaded, but it's still pretty hot up there. I drank over 2 liters of water. 

Many people mention the sharp rocks and the need for hiking shoes, but I walked the trail wearing hiking socks (see photo). I also could have hiked in flip flops, although I am an experienced flip flop hiker with strong feet. 

Here's a tip - although the natural way up the mountain from the paved pathway is to follow the first trail you come to, if you continue around the paved pathway you will come to what would normally be the exit point off the mountain. If you use this path to ascend, you will reach the second view point in just 350 meters, and there are no sharp rocks to walk across. It's a pretty steep climb though!

The home was owned by an upper middle class family during the time when the area was a neighborhood of homes and tree lined streets instead of high rise apartments, ugly 60ish style cement block shops, and a couple expressways devouring the peaceful post WWII neighborhoods. The daughter, (who grew up in the house) saw the importance of saving the house when she became a well known university professor and saw her whole neighborhood vanishing. She was able to donate the estate to the city for a museum. During the process she was able to move her father‚Äôs teakwood clinic to the backyard of the small museum grounds.

The falls are lovely but only 2 of the falls were more than a few meters in height, the rest are smaller tiers along a babbling brook. The area is well maintained with plenty of parking, clean toilets, and spaces to change clothing.
Now for the negatives.  We came to this spot because locals had said it wasn't as crowded as Erewan Falls. This is true, but on a busy day, it could be very full as well with only a few families. When we were there, we were the only people in the water.  People said these are the most beautiful falls in Thailand. This is such a subjective statement and we have visited others that are more impressive and just as beautiful.  
On arrival, admission is 300Baht per person plus 30Baht per car. Most signage is in Thai. We walked down about 10 minutes to access for swimming at the 3rd falls. On arrival we  were told we had to pay to go in the water and the staff didn't want our friends, who were not swimming, to walk further. It was not pleasant as we were actually yelled at by the Thai attendant (the only time in 5 weeks a Thai raised their voice to us). We walked back up to the car, got our 20Baht each and walked back down, about 15 minutes. Then she insisted we leave 100Baht each for a deposit for the mandatory life jackets. We only brought money for swimming, had the tickets, and just said no  we had to pass this spot on the way out so would drop them off. She was mad. There was signage at the booth clearly stating that swimming was 20 Baht but there was no indicator for deposits or receipts. We had only brought down 20 Baht each from the car. She followed our friends for quite a while shouting 'No swim, no swim'. They were walking the trail. We intended to swim and were willing to pay but this should have been stated before we left the parking lot so we didn't have to climb up and down. On our way out, the booth was closed and she was nowhere to be seen. We left the life jackets with park workers. This really colored our experience here as foreigners.  The site was lovely but not extraordinarily.  Given our experience here, I would recommend, if you are deciding between the two, to choose Erewan Falls.

I spent 7 days there and it was no where near enough. 

Accomdation:
There are 2 camps and the accomdation differs.  I paid for a basic room and was in the yoga camp.  If I went back I would stay at the muay Thai boxing camp as the rooms are more modern and next to the pool.  However, although basic, they have everything you need and are cleaned every day.  You don't spent alot of time in your room. 

Trucks run from one camp to the other at certain times however outwith there are bikes to use.  I walked a few times and it isn't long just make sure you avoid the rain! 

Timetable: 
Packages vary however I had the full fitness and wellness package.  The only issue I had was trying to fit everything in !! There's loads of choice; muay thai is on twice per day and there are a number of different yoga options with something different every day.  The muay thai rainers are amazing, they make you work hard however have a laugh with you whilst doing it! The yoga teachers all have different styles but each one of them are so kind, friendly and knowledgeable and go above and beyond to support you.  This was amazing given I was totally new to yoga! There are trips also.  I didn't attend alot of them given my short stay. 

Food: 
The food was great.  Everything is prepared fresh each day.  You can request a raw breakfast/ dinner.  I had a raw breakfast every morning with a few eggs and it was so fresh and tasty. Breakfast and dinner is served however for lunch you help yourself to tuna, cheese, bread etc from the fridges  theses are located at both camps. 

It's hard to sum this place up in a review. For me it was a total mental and physical reset and kicked started a healthier lifestyle back home.",Once in a lifetime trip,Solo travel,2024-07-31,5,Muay Thai Battle Conquer,Phetchabun,P03012900
4113,2,12787623,en,959307446,"I had no idea what to expect when I signed up for two months at Battle Conquer, but it ended up being exactly what I needed! 

I‚Äôm 51 and spending a year traveling the world on sabbatical. My goal is to learn new things, so learning Muay Thai seemed like a fun option. I signed up for the wellness package after seeing some other classes I might enjoy. 

When I arrived, I was so nervous! Would I fit in? Would I be terrible at it? Would I be the only person who hadn‚Äôt done Muay Thai before? Would I be the oldest person? What I found was an incredibly welcoming and diverse group of fantastically fun and non-judgmental people of all different skill levels and abilities from all over the world. Classes were fun and it really did feel like being at summer camp as a kid. 

I also learned that I‚Äôm not really into Muay Thai, but that I absolutely love yoga! Laura, Grace, Anjelie, Chris, and a couple of other wonderful teachers each had their own teaching styles that made classes fun and challenging. (Special shout out to Laura and Grace, whose kindness and encouragement still mean so much.) I spent my days in yoga classes, at the pool, and laughing, laughing, and more laughing with so many beautiful people who were on their own journeys. 

Sixty days went by so fast, and like so many other people who come, I hope to return one day, maybe even as a yoga instructor.

When it came to yoga you left the shala feeling stretched, relaxed and peaceful. The staff are also very lovely and always happy to help out or crack a joke with you. Battle conquer is what you make it and can be sociable with many good trips to see the monk, lakes, mango walk, town drop offs etc or even just socialising with the many great people the camp seems to attract or it can be focused more on the Muay Thai, yoga or even gym side. One on ones are offered for Muay Thai and yoga and are hugely beneficial and Benz is always happy to guide you in the gym.

4145,7,4322842,en,522104419,"Nam Nao National Park is on the major highway between Northeast Thailand and North Thailand.  This makes the highway busy.  The busy season for the park is during winter because it gets colder there that most of Thailand.  That is why the thermometer is famous - to show how cold it is!  Since we went in August it was warmer, but definitely cooler than the Bangkok area.  We drove about 5 hours from Ayutthaya Province.  The park was not very busy at all.  Some days we were the only tourists around!  The weekend, which was the Queen's birthday and thus a holiday, was a bit busier - but still there were very few around except the workers.  We stayed 6 nights.
We stayed in bungalow 301.  It is the only 6 bed cabin.  It worked well for our group - 2 grandparents, 2 parents, and 5 children.  The one room had 4 beds, wall to wall, so no one would roll out of bed unless they were sideways.  The parents and children all slept there.  The children were ages 8 months to 10 years.  They did have a small playpen for the baby to use, but she sometimes slept with everyone else.  This room had a cupboard with 6 towels in it. It also had 4 hooks to hang things on. The other room had 2 beds side by side, and worked well for the grandparents.  This room was also the main room.  There was a decent size refrigerator with separate door for the freezer, which was nice.  We hadn't expected a refrigerator so had brought a cooler and ice, expecting to use boxed milk (which the Thai use regularly) after the first day or two.  We refroze the ice and used it when we returned.  There was a TV (which we didn't use), a hot pot, and some bowls, cups and silverware, and a dish drainer.  There was a cabinet that was locked that we used for a counter.  This room had one power strip that was the only power outlet. There was a little bit of empty space in this room, which was needed for walking back and forth.  The front door was at the foot of the beds.  The bathroom was off of this room as well.  This was a typical Thai bathroom with shower, sink & toilet (Western style) all together with no partitions.  There was a hot water heater, but the higher you turned the heat up the slower the water flowed.  There was a mirror over the sink with a ledge for toothbrushes & toothpaste.   There was also a back door to a little porch where there was a sink for washing dishes. There were screens on the windows, but there were cracks around the doors.  Also the bathroom drain was unscreened so large spiders and moths flew in there.  One night I got bit numerous times so turned on the light and found my bed was full of tiny ants that were biting me.  They were coming in under the door at the foot of the bed and found a shirt that had a bit of fruit juice on it.  These ""sugar ants"" bite!!  There was a can of bug killer in the cabin and a quick spray on the bottom of the door stopped the ants.  There was a small covered porch where there was a table and 4 chairs.  There was a little yard with a concrete picnic table and 4 concrete stools, but there were lots of ants by the table and all over the yard.  We still played a lot in the yard.  One night we went outside and watched the beautiful Perseids Meteor Shower, something we could not have seen from the city.
 I will try to scan the map of where the bungalows are so you can get some idea of where certain numbers are.  There is not a map on the National Park webpage. The cabins seem to spread out from the Visitor's Center.  There are usually 2 cabins somewhat close together.  Cabin 301 was the closest, which made it easy to go get ice cream cones or bars from the little ""gift shop"".  There was one little restaurant open that we ate at every day, either for lunch or supper/dinner.  The prices were a little higher than other places, but still not bad.  A meal for all 9 of us that would usually coast about 600 baht ($18 US) cost about 800-900 baht ($25-$27).  That includes drinks.
WARNING: The trails that start by the Visitor's Center have leeches on them.  On the sign it says snails, but these are land leeches.  We started taking one trail the first morning, assuming that this would be like the leech trails at Kao Yai National Park, where we got 2 leeches on 6 of us the whole walk.  These trails are very leechy!!  We turned around shortly as the 4 year old started to shriek and we all had leeches on us - on our socks, under our feet on the insoles of our sandals, on our legs, etc.  These leeches look like dark inch worms - they crawl like inch worms and are small and thin.  They keep one end on the ground and wave the other end around looking for a victim!  They bite right through your socks, crawl up your legs, and hang on leaving your leg bloody when pulled off!  We later bought special canvas leech socks at the ""gift shop"" for 80 baht a pair (about $2.50) for the ones who decided to brave the leech hike.  In the one kilometer hike the 6 year old counted about 120 leeches.  These are just the ones she saw - not all those that were hiding in the leaves.  The man at the Visitor's Center told us the leech socks were 30 baht a pair.  I don't know if their price went up that much or if that is the price during the busy season and it was higher because it was off season.  
There are other trails that do not have leeches on them.  The hike to the Sai Thong waterfall and Heo Sai waterfall had no leeches.  However the pamphlet given to us at the entry gate was not accurate.  We decided to go to the farther one first, then return to the other.  In the pamphlet it says that Sai Thong waterfall is only 500 meters beyond Hao Sai.  When we arrived at the ""Y"" one sign said Sai Thong 2375 meters and Hao Sai 120 meters.  We went to the left and walked a while and came to a stream that went over Hao Sai waterfall.  It was pretty, and refreshing.  We walked on and on until the 8 year started screaming!  She had hit a wasp nest and was covered in wasps.  Grandpa took his shirt off and knocked the wasps off of her.  The 8 year old got 9 stings, the 10 year old got one, and Grandpa and Daddy each got one rescuing the others.  Needless to say we turned around there and went to Hao Sai waterfall.  We soaked the stings at the stream, then continued to the other waterfall.  The children played around by the waterfall and Grandpa went swimming.  We went back another day and all splashed in the water, stood under the waterfall, and swam for several hours.  The water was the perfect temperature to play in for hours!!  This was the favorite day for many of us.  We took a picnic lunch and ate it as far away from where we were playing as possible as the ants were awful.  Daddy dropped the rest of us off and then went to the nearest town to get gas and some groceries.  He still had time to play in the water after he got back!!  
One evening we went to ""Sunset Viewpoint"" or ""Tham Pha Hong"" viewpoint.  We went early so we could look for a small cave that seemed to be near.  There was a parking area by the main road where we parked.  There was a road that we walked up, but it had huge puddles and was very muddy - suitable only for 4 wheel drive vehicles or motorcycles.  We came to the end of the road and found the path, stairs, going up to the viewpoint, but no sign for the cave.  We split up, going 3 different directions and found the cave by going past the parking area or viewing area there on a small winding path along the side of the hill.  There was a steep ladder going up to the cave so Daddy helped all the children with Grandpa receiving at the top but Grandma stayed down as she had hurt her wrist.  While she was waiting Grandma heard a loud racket, and thought it was from crows or squirrels.  Well she finally saw two monkeys!!  Phayre's Leaf-monkey is what they have there, and they were swinging in the tree tops.  We all went up the 259 steps to the viewpoint and took pictures but came down before the sun set because it would have been hard to come down all those steps in the dark.  We spread a mat on the parking area and ate our picnic and watched the sun set.  It was beautiful!
Most of the hikes required us to leave the National park boundaries, but we just showed our pass each time and only had to pay the first time.  Sometimes we didn't even need to show anything as they recognized us.  
There were lots of signs warning of elephants, but we never saw any elephants.  There were many lovely butterflies, moths and birds that we saw.  We saw dung of different animals, smelled animals nearby, and saw ""foot"" prints of many animals, but did not see any large animals at all.  We did see a large - about 6 inches long - black scorpion on the driveway one time, but it never got near us.
Hint - we took a clothesline along and found a way to hang it up under the eaves of the porch.  It came in very handy - for bath towels, for swim suits, and so we could wash juicy clothes right away to keep the ants at bay.  Take soap along for washing clothes as well as dishes.",Refreshing stay - Cabin was simple but nice,Family,2017-08-31,4,Nam Nao National Park,Phetchabun,P03005304

For those who like to trek the festival is accessible without a tour bus or car. At the foot of the mountain leading to the park is a bus stop. There are usually a couple of young men with motorcycles waiting at the stop (motorcycle taxi) to ferry people to the top. The trick is to hire the driver for a couple of hours to wait while you are in the park so they can take you back down. There is no regular transportation provided by the park back to the bus stop.

You will ride for about 10 minutes, and at the middle of trip, the driver would offer to take your photos using your camera. Don't forget to give him some money tips when its done. *grin*

When you done, you'll find ur photos taken by the local photographers, and if you want to buy it, you only need 100baht. So cheap i guess.

The floating market was more than just a place to shop; it was a lively community where vendors, many of whom had been there for generations, greeted us with warm smiles and offered samples of their goods. The highlight was the incredible variety of food, including refreshing coconut ice cream and a delicious lunch at an open-air restaurant. We also enjoyed bargaining for unique souvenirs.

I chose to explore but not brave the heat.
Thus, I chose to visit Khlong Toei Market at night, noting that it was open 24 hours.
Yes, the market is open 24 hours‚Ä¶which does not necessary mean that all the stalls are open.
A handful of stalls are open.
Thus, you do not get to experience the market, at its full blown state, with the hustle and bustle‚Ä¶

If you are keen on getting fresh fruits at pretty affordable prices and you are within the Sukhumvit area,
Khlong Toei is worth a visit.
Across the street is the open air food areas serving local Thai fares.
As the food are mostly cooked fresh, I would say that they are generally safe to eat if you are concerned.

Last week I was in Bangkok to visit a good friend who had recently started living in the city as a digital nomad. I was keen to find somewhere that could provide a great massage both to untie some knots left over from the flight and to just relax and enjoy my holiday in general.

After some quick Trip Advisor and Google review research, Dahra Spa looked the part - close location (Silom Branch), extensive menu and great reviews. I booked myself in for an hour treatment, a Royal Thai massage.

On visiting, I was very impressed with the facilities and the service - the receptionist was very organised and welcoming, the waiting area was very comfortable and the overall vibe of the place was incredibly relaxing - no mean feet after you step off the busy streets of Bangkok in Silom.

I was asked if I had areas I wanted to focus on, areas I wanted to avoid, medical conditions, pressure levels etc - it was a very thorough and professional experience.

The massage itself was excellent - the first part was very relaxing and targeted to the areas I wanted to focus on, so lots of tension in my upper back, shoulders, neck etc (typical desk worker). Pressure was great and the therapist regularly checked in to see how everything was feeling.

The second part was very much the Thai Massage experience, with a lot of manipulation into different positions, stretching and massage. It can seem a bit intimidating at first, but the reason it works so well at Dahra is they clearly know exactly what they were doing - where I was stretched, moved and massages, everything was done within my limits and without causing any pain or discomfort.

I walked away feeling lighter and more comfortable than I had felt in a long time - an absolutely wonderful experience. I cannot recommend Dahra Spa enough.

It looks as though they are given preferential treatment, even though they also cannot buy, in theory, until 30 days before at 8.30am Thai time.  When we looked initially every site said you couldn't reserve until 30 days before and by the time we found that agents were taking bookings earlier it was too late and they were not taking any more bookings for our travel date in early November 2023.

Type of shops: Clothes such as stoll, shirts, jeans etc, food such as dried fruits (not dry fruits), sea food, fresh fruits/shakes/juices, shawarma, corn, cococnut ice cream and souvenir shops.

Payment: Almost all of the shops accept ONLY cash. Very few were accepting payments via digital modes such as QR code. I was not able to spot shops accepting credit/debit cards. So make sure you carry an ample amount of cash (Thai Baht)

Parking: Ample car/bike parking is available along the outskirts of the market. I am not sure whether there was any dedicated parking lot. But everyone was parking along the side and this was free.

Entertainment: Live music stage has been setup right in the center of the market with numerous tables where you can grab a seat to enjoy the food and music.

Things to keep in mind: 
-No washroom facility so you need to smart enough to enter the nearby established outlets/supermarkets and (maybe) make a purchase before you are allowed to use the washroom.

The entire street transforms into a water-filled playground, where locals and tourists alike come together to celebrate the Thai New Year with water fights, traditional ceremonies, and endless festivities.

The energy on Khao San Road during Songkran is infectious, with music blasting from every corner, colorful water guns spraying in all directions, and people dancing and laughing in the streets. It's a true celebration of unity and joy, where cultural traditions blend seamlessly with modern revelry.

One of the most memorable aspects of the festival is the sense of camaraderie among participants. Strangers become friends as they engage in friendly water battles, sharing laughs and good vibes throughout the day. It's a time when everyone, regardless of background or nationality, comes together to embrace the spirit of Songkran. 

Of course, no review of the Songkran Festival on Khao San Road would be complete without mentioning the delicious street food stalls lining the street. From traditional Thai dishes to international favorites, there's something to satisfy every craving as you take a break from the water festivities.

Other more famous ones cater mainly for tourists and they all have very similar menus to choose from.  Khao can offer mainstream cooking class but more importantly, they have great selection of dishes for serious amateur chef like me, who does not work in a restaurant.  For those who are more adventurous and curious about Thai cuisine, this is THE place to be.  From the assistants to the instructors, everyone there is super passionate about food and thai cuisine.  Our instructors, JC and Toey, both had been chefs at a great thai restaurant.  They love what they do and you can feel that through out the classes that they want us to love thai food and they teach us to cook like a thai!

We learnt to make common dishes such as Phad Thai, Satay, and curries.  But we made pretty much everything from scratch.  We made the curry paste with a mortar.  We tasted the curry paste as we made it, so we know what flavor we are aiming for.  We had the recipes but what JC always tried hard to teach us was what the ""flavor"" should be like because that is a better way to learn the dishes.  

We also learn to make some dishes that are not common in America.  We made many salads and seafood dishes that are commonly found in Asia and in more authentic thai restaurants.  Through cooking different dishes, we learnt about Thai cooking and Thai's way of  life.  It was just wonderful.

JC is a great instructor.  She will always take the time to answer our questions.  She taught us the components and complexities of thai food.  She introduced us to all the thai ingredients and how to achieve the balance of the sweetness, saltiness and spiciness in Thai food.  Everyone at Khao takes cooking to a whole new level: Even the garnishes and plating are professionally done.  You can see from the photos.

The class started with some information about Thai cooking and then a demonstration  and tasting of the things we were going to learn to make.  Then we each went to our woks and were assisted in making 4 dishes - Tom Yum soup, Stir fried chicken with cashew nut, fried rice and green curry.  We also learnt how to make the paste for green and red curry.  

I would highly recommend this cooking school.  Lots of great advise was given about substitutions for vegetables etc that you may not be able to get in your home country.

I was planning a recent trip to Bangkok and I decided to ask a friend that is a corporate chef for a major chain for reccomendations for a chef school in Bangkok. He reccomended Khao San. In looking at their website you will probably recognize several culinary figures here in the US and around the world that have attended the school. The school was founded by Kobkaew Najpinit and her daughter, Ning. Kobkaew is considered the godmother of Royal Thai cuisine. Kobkaew and Ning have been invited several times to lecture and present at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone here in the US. They have consulted on several Thai cookbooks by some of the best known chefs of Thai cuisine. I was very excited to get the opportunity to learn Thai cooking at Khao San. 
The way the school is set up is you select 3 dishes that you would like to prepare. The ingredients necessary are assembled. Ning not only explains the ingredients and preparation techniques but also makes sure that she illustrates the history and cultural importance of the dish. Food is extremely important to the Thai culture. While Ning and her brother do an excellent job in the techniques of wok frying or grinding curry pastes, they particularly excel in explaining Thai culinary culture. Ning actually holds a masters degree in anthropology in addition to being a very good chef. The school is set up in the back of the D&D Inn on Khao San (or sarn) road. This area of Bangkok is kind of a funky, bohemian area of backpackers and hippies and worth a visit even if not attending the school. However, the school is very professionally equiped, light. airy and very clean. I know there are several more ""tourist"" oriented schools mass marketed in Bangkok, however if you want the same culinary training in Thai cusine that many of the most well known chefs around the world have gotten then I would reccomend the Khao San Cooking school.",A Professional Culinary Experience for the Home Chef,NONE,2011-04-30,5,Khao San Cooking School,Bangkok,P03013450

We took BTS from our hotel and got off at BTS Saphan Taksin station. The pier is right below the station as you exit. (Walk towards the river.)  On the far left of the pier is the Ticket booth for Chao Phraya Tourist Boat. We bought a One Day River Pass for 150 THB. They staple your receipt onto their brochure. (Don't lose it.) Soon the boat arrived and we got on. Since the weather was hot, we decided to sit ""inside"" the boat which was actually quite nice. It was open window so we caught the nice river breeze. We were going to The Grand Palace for our first stop. If you sit on the left side of the boat, you'll see ICON Siam and Wat Arun along the way before reaching The Grand Palace. They also make a pier stop at Ratchawong for Chinatown and Rajinee for Wat Pho and Museum Siam.

After visiting The Grand Palace, we got back onto the boat and went to ICON Siam for lunch before catching the boat again to head back to Sathorn pier where it was an easy walk to BTS Saphan Taksin.

The museum includes items from a pre-existing coin exhibition, now closed, that was previously located in the Grand Palace.

The only criticism I have is that the tour lasts only 1-1/2 hrs and is rushed. There is so much to see that an increase in length to 2 hours would seem appropriate. For example, there is one area with a set of coins of each denomination for a large number of the world‚Äôs countries, maybe all, didn‚Äôt catch how many. Children are encouraged to rush around stamping a souvenir booklet with images of the coins, which is fun, but adults don‚Äôt have time to look at every country‚Äôs exhibit.

Benjakiti Park is not just a normal green park because It contains four zones of forest which are different. Therefore, the visitors can visit several forests in one place. To visit around the park, the visitors can walk or run along the passageways which are arranged nicely. There are slow runways, fast runways, and bicycleways. Also, there are walkways through the forests which allow the visitors to perceive the forest's atmosphere, which is a unique point compared with other parks in Bangkok. The visitors should visit there after 5 PM because the weather is super hot and they can get burned by the strong sunlight of Thailand. Moreover, visitors can go there conveniently by taking the BTS Skytrain to Asoke station, and the MRT subway to Sukhumvit station.

I called and made a booking with the receptionist, she  said they could accept 1.5hr booking, when I arrived they said they can only accept 1 hr because they need to save time for cleaning rooms. I was disappointed.

After massage I asked for her help to get a taxi for me, she then helped to call Grab. After a few mins she said the taxi arrived and asked me to go down. She walked me down to ground floor and told me I cannot use the main entrance but can only use the entrance at the back. I was on my own and it was 10:30pm I did not feel safe using the entrance at the back, but I had no choice.

When I reached the front street there was no taxi at all! After a few mins a taxi just came to me and spoke Thai. I asked if the Spa called him he just kept saying ""Yes OK OK"" so I got on the taxi. Then I received a call from receptionist asking why didn't I get on the taxi? I said well you told me the taxi was there but there was no taxi! And you didnt tell me the car plate number!

I was very lucky that the taxi driver did take me back to my hotel in the end but he did not follow the route shown on Google map and I felt it was intentional. He charged me 200 THB, I asked hotel concierge they said 200 is too expensive should only be 120 THB. I then only paid 120 THB.

Crap experience with the receptionist, I don't feel they take my safety seriously. Do not go to this branch - aged and worn. Go to Sukhumvit or Langsuan branch - they provide very professional service.

The palace was called  Phra Racha Wang Derm (the original palace) after King Rama the first came into power in 1782. 
Because of its strategic location, the King placed important royal family members in Phra Racha Wang Derm. This practice continued until King Rama V.

Feels like going to Chatuchak market but not crowded and not easily lost.  because it is clearly divided into zones  Both the pet zone, the tree zone, the food zone, the second-hand zone and various appliances.  There is also a park that is a garden groove as well.  For those who want to relax with family  or to exercise such as running  It's also appropriate.

There are quite a lot of parking spaces here.  but never enough to stop  especially during Saturday and Sunday  There will be a lot of people.  Expenses can be viewed at the arrival point when receiving the card.  As for other forms of travel  It will be a bus like 2 rows (written on the sign saying go to Sanam Luang 2) that can go up at the beginning of the line at Bang Khae Market.

  3. The food zone is a zone that exists throughout Sanam Luang 2, whether it is a restaurant, canteen, selling food for takeout.  Famous places have popular egg snacks.  If you come here, don't miss out on buying them as souvenirs.  Other food  For example, there are shops like Kim Yong Market to open here as well.  The price might be a little expensive.  But if compared to not having to go down to carry at Hat Yai up, it's worth it.
 
  4. Second-hand sales zone  It is a zone that is located along with the front zone.  But this period is quite busy especially.  with a lot of salespeople flocking to sell  And the people who come to buy things will be clustered in this zone quite a lot.

I was supposed to camp up there for a night because of the rain and my flight schedule I changed my mind. The rain doesn't stop me.

I spent most of my energy shuffling in the nutella mud on my way up. I was lucky that the rain stops after 4 hours of hiking. The sun came up. Able to view the mountain goats from a distance and the most pleasant smelling flower such as pink lady and lavender. This is what I came for.

He was appointed as the 2nd King when his brother took over the throne then.

The construction and design of this temple is unique and different from a royal palace style, locally we called this the art Wang Na ( front palace) style. For those who are interested in Thai art, you may also observe this at the National museum which was a former palace of the second king and at Wat Mahatat.

I came across this Wat online as was looking for somewhere peaceful to go - off the beaten track. After spending a month travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - it's safe to say we were ""templed out"".

But this Wat was something else. All month long me and hubs talked about how we had visited many Wat's but not heard a single prayer. So this experience was definitely one to remember. 

We follow the lunar calender, as do Monks and so were very pleased to be vising on full moon night. We arrived at 4pm and heard some ladies mic-checking and immediately got very excited that we were about to experience something spectacular.

Indeed we did.

We were greeted (as the only non native attendees) by English speaking ladies of the temple and monk's, we were given explanations of proceedings for the evening and so made ourselves comfortable.

I would certainly recommend this Wat if you are looking for somewhere to go that makes you forget where you are. Away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.

This temple was believed that it was built during King Narayana of Ayudthaya ( about 330 years ago), this temple became the first royal temple for Ratanakosin ( Bangkok) since it was restored by Somdej Pra Bovorn Rat Jao Mahasurasinghanat, a younger brother of King Rama I, who was during the same era promoted as 2nd king, aka, Wang Na ( a front palace). The architecture of the front palace is different from the architecture and design of royal palace art. From my personal opinion, it is difficult to say which one is better, it's just different. The Buddha statues were collected from all over the country and restored after Siam-Burma war end about 230 years ago. In the past centuries, this temple was restored by many kings and royal family. It is considered as one the important temple in the capital as a traditional Siam capital's temple.

This is a great place to explore and there are so many photo opportunities, we have called in here quite a few times over the years and we are usually the only people there.

There is also a small airconditioned museum with a couple of different rooms and you will find life size wax figures of various famous monks plus Chinese and Indian statues. The museum is off to the far right hand side of the complex.

It was unfortunately raining when we made a brief stop-over. There were two beautiful temple building flanking the statue/building

I was spoken to like I am a DOG by the dentist! I am not exaggerating!  I am absolutely in shock! I have lived in Thailand nearly 20 years and this is the first time I have been spoken to (shouted at!) in this way by anyone. I am especially shocked it was from a health ""professional"".

I was polite and friendly (I am a quiet person). As soon as I entered the female dentist  gave me a disgusted look.

Eventually, after having her back to me for a long time she turned around and said loudly and sharply, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?""
I was quite surprised but began to explain which is when she began shouting, repeating the same thing at me over and over.

I tried to explain that i was experiencing but she would not listen and continued to shout the same thing over and over! OMG, I had no words left. I just wanted to get out of there. I am too polite and regret not shouting back at her and telling her she has no right to speak to people like they are dogs!

I have been to CMU dental facility several times in the past and the staff are polite and many dentists are nice, but my recent experience has been SHOCKING and this dentist really should not be in the profession because she has NO IDEA HOW to speak to patients or people in general.

I am already a very nervous patient in a dentist facility and she has made the fear even worse! I am embarrassed to say I left the dental facility in tears because it was really a shock. I thought that by going to a private university dental practice, that I would be given accurate helpful information but I did not think that it would involve treating me like dirt.

I will now look for a different dental facility to help with my dental problem. A place where you are spoken to with a decent level of respect.

CMU, please could you send your dental staff for customer care training and teach them how to properly handle patients. This is NOT OK.

After +1 hour in the minivan transfer you arrive at the pier where they will check you in and give you a very quick overview of the trip.

However the crew is very clear in one messages and that is that you would need to pay an fine of 1500 Thai Bath (as much as the costs of the entire tour) if you lose one snorkel set. Not to mention that these snorkel sets were of the quality of your local second hand market and where nearly falling apart. If you expect to see clear waters, beautiful coral and extraordinary fish, please don‚Äôt book this tour. Visibility in this spot is around 1 meter, the coral consists of one rock in the sea with some dead plants and coral attached to it. It felt like we just got dropped on the middle of the sea since it was on the way to pig island. Where normally you would have time to snorkel for more then an hour, you actually get around 30 mins. Additionally the spot was quite dangerous since we were at open sea were the waves quite high. You risked to get smashed into the coral rock or worse a sea urchin. Again no information on safety was provided by the crew. After the short snorkel stop you head straight for pig island. Here you are dropped of again without any information on its history or rules.

5335,2,17382608,en,721490111,"My wife read about the '100 Years Old Wooden Bridge' and determined we would see it. I am pleased that she made that decision, though like many things Thai, the signposting left a lot to be desired, but eventually we got there.
To be honest, on first sight I somewhat disputed the term 'bridge' thinking it was more of a wooden board walk. Though a bridge it is, as it spans a physical obstacle, the rice paddy, without impacting upon the rice and does provide a safe passage from one side to the other.
The bridge is a mere 1 metre high built as it indicates out of timber, though some of its 400 metres of timber planking has been renewed. This does not detract from the whole vista rather the smell of the freshly laid timber enhanced the feeling of being in the country. 
I should mention that some of the boards are out of alignment and some of the newly laid a bit springy, though as all that is required is a sedate walk there should be no problems.
The view from the bridge is one of endless rice paddy interspersed on occasions with yellow and orange fragrant flowers, their colours contrasting with the green of the rice. I would recommend visitors wear a hat or carry an umbrella as on our visit the sun beat down mercilessly.
There is however little shady spot under a tree complete with a wooden bench for those hot and tired and wanting a rest. Or people like us who just wanted to sit and relax and take in the serenity of the area. 
We entered the bridge from the highway side where free parking is available. I believe that there is another entry point at the end of the bridge behind the cafe/restuarant. The cafe/restaurant is called 'Tatone Garden Cafe Restaurant'. This establishment serves cold drinks and basic, cheap and delicious Thai food at a reasonable price, There is some shaded and undercover eating areas available and plenty of seating. It was a pleasant place to relax, take advantage of the tranquility of the place and enjoy a quick snack.
This is not the 8th Wonder of the World, but I enjoyed the uniqueness of the place, noting that it was originally built as a working construction (not a tourist attraction) to service a need, that of enabling workers in the past and possibly to this day to safely access the rice crops and cross from one piece of land to another, without getting their feet wet.

Staff members were extremely rude. They had a go at my daughter for wearing the wrong socks and never came to me (probably because I am farang). It's what annoyed me - that they made her upset and didn't talk to me first. I spoke Thai to some of the staff members but they just looked at me with disdain, didn't give me the time of day. They eventually dug out an English speaking member. I asked the staff member a valid reason why she must wear harbourland branded socks and she kept saying regulation but never gave me a real reason why. I kept saying the sign in English says standardised socks. Doesn't say anything about it needing to be a certain brand. She would not take no for an answer. Would not let it go.

If you have a simple request like my kid wants to play this one (buffet)and that one with parents, the staffs play‚Äùdon‚Äôt understand game‚Äù or they really don‚Äôt understand ( in this case they have no idea what they doing)

Also 3 times I came here, I had been told different policy for same games. ( basically they want you to buy more tickets but with very inefficient way, wasting MY time only because they don‚Äôt even have customer at that time.)
I don‚Äôt mind paying more money, but as a business, 3 times different rules? Are they made by individual staffs by that minute? Depends on the staff‚Äôs mood?

Some staffs were not happy, some of them are sad and miserable, I cant imagine these people would care for kids. One of them almost slammed the door with my kid‚Äôs figure there.

Buying tickets are difficult takes long time. They really build up a messy system. Last 2 times I came here I felt like run away from the cashier(downstairs only, upstairs were fine) they are very difficult to communicate while I feel like they are not going to help with anything even they understand( most them speaks zero English).

Our accommodation is on the Khlong San side of Taksin bridge and we arranged a 'grab hire' where we had the use of car and driver within greater Bangkok for 4 hours at a cost of 1200 Baht. It took 45 mins to get there and 1hr 15 mins to get back so we had two hours at the fort. An hour of this was spent exploring the Mae Khlong ship - access all areas and it was fascinating, then there are the gun placements, Rama V statue, military hardware exhibition and Mangrove walkway compete with monkeys, which we skilfully avoided.

On top of all this you can see out to the Gulf of Thailand and watch shipping entering the Chao Phraya river. There was a large seafront restaurant which was reasonably busy considering it was a weekday, we only had time to buy drinks and ice creams though.

You may disagree, but this is my idea of a great day trip from Bangkok and the Grab option just gave us peace of mind that our transport was sorted so we didn't have to worry how we were going to get back to the city. 

Entrance to the fort with all its attractions is free.

We took passports with us as entry is through a checkpoint  but we were not asked for them, perhaps as we arrived with a Thai national who was driving the car. I did spot one other western visitor who was wearing some kind of pass so perhaps if you arrive by tuk tuk or taxi, you may need to provide ID.

In itself it is not really impressive.

But over the years it has played an important role for the local fishing community.   Returning from sometimes dangerous trips to sea, fishermen  would know that they had returned safely home when they could see the spire on the top of the chedi.

So don‚Äôt bother asking Thai people for ‚ÄúIsaan Buddhist Park‚Äù, just say the full name or simply ‚ÄúChedi Mongkol‚Äù ‚Äì and everybody knows what you mean.

Please don‚Äôt ask me for instructions on how to get there. A local friend from Roi-et drove me all the way. The location is approximately 90 kilometres North of Roi-et town. There is no village nearby. The chedi is in the middle of nowhere, so to say. I don‚Äôt think you can go there by public transport. You have to go by group tour or hire someone to drive you there. If you decide to drive by yourself, get directions from google maps first.
Surprisingly enough, there was a large Tesco Lotus in one of the villages on the way, just in case.

Shortly before arrival you pass many restaurants. They all sell the same: Grilled chicken and grilled fish, the one with the thick crust of salt ‚Äì very delicious!

Upon arrival you can see that the chedi is in the hills of a jungle area. From the parking lot you can either walk five minutes or take the small tractor-train to reach the entrance. The train is free of charge and so was the entrance to the chedi. Avoid Buddhist holidays if you can. There were not many people during my visit, but I‚Äôve been told that it can get very crowded on certain days.  

The structure is big, I mean really huge. On one sign it is said that the foundation of the building is 101 metres in diameter and the total height is 101 metres as well, referring to the name of the province you are in (Roi-et means ‚Äúone hundred-one‚Äù). The garden surrounding the chedi is well maintained and the photo opportunities are seemingly endless.

When you enter the chedi, you‚Äôll find yourself in a gigantic hall that is nearly empty. In the middle of the room are the Buddha images. This area is relatively small in comparison to the rest of the hall. The next two floors look basically the same: Huge empty space with a Buddha worship corner.

I am still puzzled over the fact that there is such a huge, well maintained place in Thailand, rivalling Bangkok‚Äôs Grand Palace in size and I never heard of it before.

A visit can be easily combined with visiting Nam Tok Soda, a waterfall not too far away. From there you can actually see Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol protruding out of the dense jungle.

Another place to add to your trip is the nearby ‚ÄúTham Pha Nam Thip Non-hunting Area‚Äù, which does not have the status of a national park, but is treated like one and it is under the authority of the Thai National Park administration.

I believe it's well known for it's somewhat large reclining Buddha that is located sort of off to the back of the main temple. The people at the Tourist Centre in town actually got the name wrong when I went there and showed them some pictures I had taken. Hey, they were nice people who seemed like they were willing to do anything to help me out, and they did. They gave me an awesome English map of Hua Hin that didn't confuse the names of places like Google Maps did online. And I discovered some new temples to see from it. The temple itself - it's quite impressive. I first visited the main temple area with it's variety of structures and statues. Something was going on here and it was quite crowded. I‚ÄôÔΩç kinda guessing it was a ceremony for a young monk (maybe monks) being ordained or whatever it is properly referred to. Respectfully, I tried to keep my distance even though no one seemed concerned with my presence. After snapping a few pics, I went through what looked like a residential area and found the Reclining Buddha. Here I spent about a half hour or so.

I was able to get that in here as nobody was around and felt comfortable doing such. I was also able to light some joss sticks that's been a habit of mine too lately. That day, I lit five instead my usual four for my immediate family. The fifth was for Brandon.

Some of their signs advertise a 360¬∞ view of the area, and there are some pretty nice ones when you get to the top. You know I had a real interesting conversation with that monk about language concerning some Buddhist terms. As well as the Thai I imagine, he knows the English words for some of these terms. What he didn't know was the Sanskrit/Pali that most Buddhists in America use (I believe). So basically, he taught me some English (well I heard those words before but didn't know exactly how they applied to Buddhism) and I taught him (a monk) some Sanskrit/Pali (both of which are sacred Buddhist languages that are similar yet different). I thought our conversation was a beautiful thing. And all you can see here is beautiful too. The large main statue is a standing golden buddha (actually an arhat/disciple) that's so tall it can probably be seen for miles.

An older monk was lying on couch watching some videos on a tablet while I was there; I hope I didn't disturb him.

Although it is legal to drive your own 4WD pickup truck, you are still recommended to hire a car and a driver because the path is cut through the dense forest and is very narrow so that 2 cars cannot use this path simultaneously, therefore all chauffeurs have to use walkie-talkie to communicate with others.

As our car climbed up the mountain (07:45 am), we (in the back of pickup truck) felt the cool fresh air with gentle breeze. After 20 minutes of penetrating through the rainforest, we reached our first stop on a huge rock at the edge of the cliff which provides panorama view of the forest below. Then, we walked to the highlight ""3 whale rocks"", 3 purple huge rocks protrude from the cliff resemble 3 whales (view from above and imagine) of different sizes ( 2 bigger rocks called ""father"" and ""mother"", while the inaccessible smaller one called ""baby""). This point also provides a panorama view of greenish forest below. 

The next stop is ""elephant rock"". Without using any imagination , it is undoubtedly an elephant! The driver then took us to ""Phu Sing gate"", 2 standing huge rocks at the edge of the cliff forming ""little gorge"" that looks like a big gate to the thick jungle (and fabulous view) below. After that, we drove to ""Phu Sing wall"", a natural vertical rock wall with beautiful pattern. Finally, our last checkpoint was a quirky place called ""Sang Roi Bor"", bumpy landscape contain hundred of holes at the edge of the cliff. Of course, you can see a panorama view of abundant forest at this point.
 
Besides the stunning views, our chauffeur was very nice and provided us some interesting historical facts about this place. Around late 70's to early 80's, the forest was used to be communists' hideout (as underground organization). Some comrades passed away here and their bodies were buried somewhere in the forest. This is why the alternate name of the forest is ""pink jungle"" (bit lighter than ""red"").

I showed up here around 10AM, hardly anyone around but when I asked if I could hire a boat, someone made a phone call and within a few minutes a boatman arrived. Be aware that not much English is spoken here, but basic communication is still possible. The boat fee is the same no matter how many are in your group - 500 thb. Trip lasted about an hour. Lots of bird life, although it's off in the distance - if you want good bird photos be sure to bring more than just a phone to take photos with. Lotus flowers were sparse, but I knew this before I arrived. The boatman said the flowers come in around December.

Be aware, as others have noted, that if you come from Hua Hin, your navigation app will have you turn off highway 4020 onto an unnamed road which turns to dirt in 50 meters. This is not the correct road. Stay on the highway another few kilometers until you reach Samroiyod 6. From here navigation is correct.

Lunch on the beach was the most bland Khao pad gai I‚Äôve ever had. If there‚Äôs not going to be a lunch buffet or anything then the food could do with being a little bit better than frozen veg with egg fried rice.

When going downhill, make sure your shoes have grip as the slope can get slippery if wet. There are handrails there if you need. 

There is a 50bht entry fee at Viewpoint 1's entrance. The funds go towards maintaining the viewpoint/s. It was also worth it with the thought and presentation that went into the decoration at VP1 specifically. VP2 was also nice and clean. 

The reason for the 4-stars (based on my experience) is because I found it to be overcrowded at VP2 at the time that I went which was around sunset. While I understand that sunset is THE ideal time to go, it would have been nice if the others weren't so loud and smoked so much weed that it made the whole place smell so pungent.

We could help ourselves to tea and coffee. Where were the snacks and light breakfast as mentioned in the leaflet? It was after 11 before we set off. 
The guide was Russian, couldn't speak English much so the whole pre boarding speech which went on for more than 10 minutes was only in Russian. I did question him! There were 3 French and 4 of us the rest Russian. Us 7 did not get any information whatsoever. We were left to figure it out. Very unsafe and not very professional. 

They sell it as a nice speed boat max 30 on board, but let me tell you there were over 40 people on board totally cramped. We had loud, rude and thoughtless Russians on board who didn't care about the rest of us. Drinking alcohol all the whole way. Now the sea was very rough and we had to wear our life jackets at all times. The boat overpacked and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. People were sick everywhere. My youngest was frightened and is now traumatised from that trip. 
We couldn't go snorkeling properly, we didn't stop at places because we couldn't and obviously Maya bay was closed, this wasn't said when booking. Basically the whole itinerary was changed. Lunch was at phi phi don, absolutely awful, the worst food we had in all the trips we did!

So the everythig about this trip, the food, the company was absolutely awful. We came away from this trip with absolute disgust. I will never do this type of trip again.
I have done more personal private boat tours of 6 to 10 people in the past and in future will stick to a more smaller and better experience rather than be moved around like cattle! 

Last note, I can see how much Thailand has changed, its all about numbers on the boats and how much money is made. There were several tour operators doing the same thing. Everyone is trying to sell you something on the islands and you are rushed everywhere from Island to Island. Such a shame. This was not a nice or enjoyable experience.

My husband booked this tour before we left and paid a deposit. He was told he would be sent details of where to meet our boat captain the afternoon before the tour & we would need to be at the place where long boats are moored on tonsai bay at 8am. 
When we asked which boat he said no, other side near slinky bar. So we had to walk to the other beach. This is not a big problem, but we were hot & worried after reading other reviews. 
Eventually (around 8:15) he sent a message  with the boat name. It was a long tail that had just arrived. 
The captain put the ladder for the boat out for us & helped us into the boat. He spoke very little but drove us to a site with lots of other boats & said it was for snorkelling & gave us snorkel each. The boat had to stop quite at away from where we were to snorkel. We swam to the shore & it was probably a bit too far for us without life jackets, although we are all very good swimmers.  
The next spot we went to was beautiful & the captain said ‚Äúfor swim‚Äù instead of snorkelling. He was spot on, it was no good for snorkelling but we swam a bit. We asked for more snorkelling & he took us just a little further away & had a great opportunity to snorkel. Then we went a loooong way from there (we were unsure where as it seems like back to tonsai bay!) & this was definitely our favourite spot‚Ä¶Nui Bay. There were amazing things to see & a beach of you wanted to swim to it. If we had more time in phi phi we might have gone back via kayak. We snorkelled a bit, had lunch then snorkelled some more. GORGEOUS creatures to see. 
While here we asked what time we‚Äôre finished & he said about 20min so we made the list to the snorkelling & then he drove us back to the bay.  
The captain was always very polite but understood pretty much zero English. This was only really a problem at the end when my husband was trying to follow Robert‚Äôs instructions to ‚Äúpay in Thai baht on the day‚Äù. He thought that meant pay the captain, so he did. 3000 baht. The captain was very unclear (later Robert explained he was new to his team of captains) but we were sent a receipt by Robert almost immediately. Curiously, later we found the amount was debited from our bank account also. My husband put a hold on the payment & emailed Robert who apologised & tried to explain it but it still didn‚Äôt make sense. We‚Äôre still not sure what happened but I think he didn‚Äôt mean for us to pay the captain cash. We have read all the reviews & we genuinely don‚Äôt think Robert is trying to scam anyone, but the communication is not clear. Perhaps it is an issue if lost in translation, also that Robert is the tour organiser but contracts out to captains to run the tours. This the need to send a recent photo & not knowing who he‚Äôd assign & where they‚Äôd be.
There were life jackets on the boat but we didn‚Äôt need to use them really. If you are at a spot where you have to swim a distance from the boat you should take them anyway to feel more security as the best snorkelling is not always right where the boat is. 
Our captain brought fried rice & stuffed omelette for our lunch, one dish each person. They were delicious. He had cut up pineapple & watermelon for us for ‚Äòmorning tea‚Äô. He also had a small bottle of cold water for each of us.
This was a private tour, only for us & we enjoyed that aspect. Our kids also benefitted from not needing to go places other people might want. 

Tips/FYI
-Ask for very specific & clear details of how much, when & how payment will be made.
-Take your own snorkel. Two of the ones available were very ordinary
-Some of the islands you could be taken to require you to pay for entry. When our captain offered & said that we would have to pay we just said no thank you.

They run an incredible operation including what has been a highly successful CNVR - catch, neuter, vaccinate, return - program not just in Phuket but other parts of Thailand too. They have an onsite hospital to care for dogs, there are many sections housing dogs (and cats) according to age, (special) needs, etc. and they do their utmost to nurture dogs so that they may return to their community, or be adopted, or be assimilated on-site. I saw videos of adopting families who spoke of how clean, clearly loved, the animals were when they received their new pet at the other end of their plane journey. It was inspiring and heart-warming to see the kindness and humane-ness these animals are experiencing after clearly going through hard lives, as seen in their lack of one or both eyes, one leg, or bearing scars. Volunteering at Soi Dog is a meaningful form of tourism, and also a wonderful opportunity to meet and connect with other traveller-volunteers from far-flung parts of the world. I highly recommend it.

One cool thing for me was all the monks-in-training. Basically, a baseball team size group of kids followed me all through the cave complex chatting in Thai (I speak a fair bit of Thai) and pointing out bee hives and all kinds of stuff that I never would have noticed on my own. 

Even without the awesome group of monks, I would have fully enjoyed the cave.

We arrived by car and took a combo ticket for Khao Phanom Rung and Prasat Hin Mueng Tum, 150 Baht per foreigner and 50 Baht parking fee. We took Gate 3 which allowed us to drive up to the top of the mountain, there from the parking place is easy access to the temple. There is another parking lot at gate 1 from where one climbs up the mountain to the level of the temple from the east. I recommend the upper parking lot for those who are not used to climb up narrow steps. 

Phanom Rung is a Hindu-Khmer temple comprising ruins of construction that was completed from the 10th to the 13th centuries. The temple has several beautiful lintels, the most famous being the Phra Narai Lintel, above the east portal, which was returned to Thailand from a museum in the United States in 1988, after the temple had been restored by the Thai Department of Fine Arts.

The view from up top is splendid. We started from the top level and climbed down to the start of the steps, with a brief visit to the Phanom Rung museum, not much to see there. The climbing up is a wonderful experience as finally the top of the main building slowly comes into sight. 

There were quite a number of local and foreign tourists but the area is so large that no crowd  developed anywhere.

We both lost 3kg , our digestion, skin, our mood and sleep have drastically changed for the best. What I love the most is that after the program, we are given plenty of resourceful protocols to continue our path for a healthier life. Thanks Ivor for that.",Great to reset your body,Couples,2024-07-31,5,The Source Herbal Detox Retreat,Samut Prakan,P03015198
5853,1,10136951,en,956743784,"I decided to do the Source‚Äôs detox to-go program for 21 days in June this year after having amazing results with 14 days of the retreat program last year. Where to begin‚Ä¶

First up, the 14-day retreat program last year was truly powerful. I lost some weight and it helped with a skin issue I had, but it was the results after the program that had the most impact. I felt like I had a new mindset and started noticing lots of little synchronicities. For example, some new job opportunities essentially fell into my lap, I met some very interesting new people, and some small things I'd wanted for a long while seemed to just materialize in my life. It‚Äôs difficult to explain, but it felt like there had been a change externally as well as internally.

I‚Äôd wanted to stay longer, but had to go back to work, so I decided to return this year and do the full 21 days to keep the positive momentum going and complete the change in myself (but as the detox to-go option, so I could still follow my regular routine).

Initially, it was a little more difficult, and I felt I needed to increase the amount of juice I was drinking to match the energy I was spending on work and going to the gym. Ivor was on-hand to talk me through the process though and give me some recommendations.¬†

After 21 days (and two liver flushes), I lost 8kg! And my skin issue had cleared completely. Even though the process was a little harder during the longer detox, I finished with a remarkable sense of peace and clarity. I was a bit worried I was too relaxed (!) and had lost my drive a little, but my motivation soon returned after I slowly reintroduced food. Apparently this calm feeling was related to clearing all the acid waste from the body, as it had become much more alkaline.¬†

If you‚Äôve ever fasted before, you know the detox clarity I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs not like your problems disappear, more that you aren‚Äôt so worried about dealing with them, and are content to let things just unfold. I really feel like it has been the ultimate reset for my body, both physically and mentally. I‚Äôm writing this just over a week later and it‚Äôs like I have an entirely new perspective. Everything feels remarkably in flow. It‚Äôs going to be exciting to see what changes happen in my life as a result.

If you can‚Äôt do the retreat program, it‚Äôs entirely doable to make the juice yourself at home or elsewhere on Koh Samui and go about life as normal with the detox to go (I did it in an Airbnb nearby and Ivor lent me a juicer!). I highly recommend doing the full 21 days if you can. It feels life changing!",Life Changing 21 Day Juice Fast,Solo travel,2024-06-30,5,The Source Herbal Detox Retreat,Samut Prakan,P03015198
5854,0,10136951,en,952956343,"I recently finished 7 days of the Source new advanced detox program and I can honestly say it is a game changer. What was most noticeable was the speed at which the change happens. Having done the normal 28 day program a few years ago, it was great and I felt good, but this new program works on a much deeper level and in a much shorter time frame. 

 I felt it open up my energy on many levels in mind body and spirit and in a profound way for me. Maybe I was just ready for this change at this precise time. It has encouraged me to make more lasting changes to my health because I want to keep this feeling of being more alive into the future. As I might have drifted back to some not so healthy habits before, I have no desire to do so now. That‚Äôs the big difference. The new feeling is too good.

 I did blood tests before and after the detox where there were a few issues with liver, kidneys and cholesterol numbers. The same blood tests after the detox were completely in the normal range and cholesterol came way down to the middle of the normal range. That‚Äôs a big shift in a small time frame, a bit unbelievable really and my doctor was quite surprised. I lost 4 kilos in the 7 days and I am still continuing to lose weight several weeks after the detox. My total weight loss is at 5kgs. I did also notice that my eyesight improved and I had a lot more energy to exercise during the program which was new to me as normally on a detox I would have just rested all day. You could probably even work while doing this.

I would say it‚Äôs definitely an accelerated program, so if you don‚Äôt want to detox for a long period of time, you can get excellent results rapidly and effectively, which has a lot of appeal if you don‚Äôt have a lot of time. It‚Äôs a game changer for detoxing.

 It‚Äôs a more expensive program but worth every penny if you care about your health. I am planning on doing the 28 day new advanced program because if I can get these results in one week, what would 28 days be like? I‚Äôm really interested to know.

We like the lobby. You take your shoes off and, upon entering, sit in a comfortable chair and receive a foot bath while soothing background music plays. Next you're escorted into the massage room.

We didn't like the temperature in the massage room. It was warm and stuffy and, on a 95-degree day, we needed cool. A fan on the wall was circulating at low speed, so I bumped it up a notch, which got the air moving.

The tables here have no face cradles, and none of the portable kind were provided for us. This makes lying on one's face very uncomfortable. Unlike the other two massage houses we visited, no clothing basket is provided here to store your clothes and personal items. I piled my clothes, purse, umbrella, and jewelry in a corner on the floor. 

Hubby and I opted to have our massages in the same room, which was a mistake because the two employees doing our massages talked frequently. They wouldn't have been able to do that, had we chosen separate rooms. Talking during a massage is distracting and annoying. 

My Thai massage was pretty thorough, although I experienced a better one a couple days ago. Herbal Steam charges 200 baht for a 1-hour Thai massage and 300 baht for a 1-hour oil massage. I paid 180 baht for the previous Thai massage. Not much difference in price at most places in the old city, except the luxury spas, which charge 2-3 times higher.

5901,0,7726805,en,672907390,"Wat Prasat is located on Intawaroot Rd across rom Wat Phra Singh, within the old city walls and was probably built at the end of the 16th cenutry. The temple complex has two chedis (pagodas). The ubosot, viharn and one chedi are constructed in a straight line.

The Lanna style viharn
The classic Lanna style viharn that was built in 1823 is a wooden structure, set on a stone base. It has a steep three tiered roof with chofah (a royal symbol representing the protector garuda) decorating the top ends. The panels on the entrance as well as the pillars are intricately decorated with carved flower motifs in Lanna style.

The stairs leading to the entrance of the viharn contain large Nagas (mythological snakes) guarding the building.A unique feature of this temple is the short tunnel that connects the viharn to the chedi behind it. Usually the viharns principal Buddha image is found towards the back of the wall opposite the entrance.

At the Wat Prasat the center of the back wall contains an ornately decorated entrance to a short tunnel that leads to the chedi directly behind it. The sitting Buddha image that can partly be seen from the viharn is actually inside the chedi.

On either side of the tunnel entrance a number of Buddha images are seated on pedestals about 1 meter high. One of the images is a bronze dating back to 1590, the others are stucco and of a more recent date. Part of the viharns walls are decorated with murals from the early 19th century.","Wat Prasat, ancient, serene and sacred",Solo travel,2019-04-30,5,Wat Prasat Temple,Nonthaburi,P03013503
5902,1,7726805,en,658165922,"Compared to the other temples in the local area, this one looks and feels much older. One can see this through the lack of straight edges on the buildings and the use of old wooden beams as corner posts.

Not worth making a planned trip for, but if you‚Äôre in the local area and you‚Äôve been to see Wat Phra Sing, then this isn‚Äôt too far a walk away.

Absolutely no tourists here and the trees surrounding the temple provide shade from the sun with a nice breeze coming through.

The temple on the left as you enter was closed but the older looking one on the right was open and had a monk in it.","Beautiful, older and smaller temple",Solo travel,2019-03-31,5,Wat Prasat Temple,Nonthaburi,P03013503

5905,4,1831068,en,752115552,"Prasat Pueai Noi is claimed to be the biggest Khmer sanctuary in the upper Northeastern. It is believed to be built in the 16th-17th century to be a place to perform Hindu religious rituals. The sanctuary consists of 3 main buildings and a library surrounded by a moat representing Mount Sumeru. The place is still well preserved and the lintel depicting reclining Vishnu is still rich in detail. However, it is noticeable that it has been renovated. 
	
Prasat Pueai Noi has several good points. Firstly, it is easy to reach as it is located next to the main road. Secondly, in case that you are deep into Khmer sanctuaries (like me), it is a good starting point of your Khmer sanctuary trail in Thailand from Khonkaen down to Sakaew. You can just use it as a stopover as it is small so it doesn‚Äôt take much time to look around. Finally, it is free of charge for both entr√©e and parking. 
	
The bad points of this place are as follows. The first one is that Pueai Noi is 1-hour drive from the heart of Khonkaen so if you are not actually interested in the sanctuary, it might not worth your time. (My house is 20-minute drive to the sanctuary, so I can use this place as a picnic site; it‚Äôs perfect for me!). Another bad point of this place is that it is very small compared to other Khmer sanctuaries like ones in Phimai and Phanom Rung. They are a lot bigger and more beautiful. 
	
Overall, I don‚Äôt recommend this place to foreign travelers who have limited time. It is better you visit the other two I have mentioned. Be that as it may, I proudly present this sanctuary to local travelers. If you ask me if I will visit this place again, my answer is ‚ÄòDEFINITELY!‚Äô. It actually depends on one‚Äôs point of view to decide if this place is worth a visit. Anyways, I hope my review helps you guys decide whether to visit or not to visit.","Small, Isolated Khmer Sanctuary",NONE,2019-09-30,3,Prasat Puay Noi,Nonthaburi,P03013503
