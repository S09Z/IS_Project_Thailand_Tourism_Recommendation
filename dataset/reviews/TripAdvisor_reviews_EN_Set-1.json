At present Wat Ratchabophit is the residence of the Supreme Patriarch, the head of the Kingdom\u2019s Buddhist community. On the temple grounds is a royal cemetery with many monuments containing the ashes of members of the immediate family of King Rama V, including wet nurses.\nI have visited Wat Ratchabophit twice, in February 2020 and now, simply because I was so impressed by its beauty and the peaceful environment, on both occasions I met only very few visitors, 3 local worshippers this time. I was lucky as I met a monk cleaning the temple grounds who spoke English and explained to me the purpose of the various buildings.",

(not sure how long this will be the case...) \n\nThe tiles are new, the gold plated, the mirrors sparkling, the  mosaic dazzling - any influencer's personal dream  -  Also a very unusual design for a temple. \n\nSlightly off the beaten track but still in the midst of  it all, about a 15 minute walk from Wat Pho in the direction of the Golden Mount -  \nThe nearest MRT station is Sam Yot or  MRT Sanam Chai  depending on your goals to visit. \n\nWell worth the visit and the time!",

I started out from Sathorn Ferry Dock near Shangri La Hotel, taking the express ferry Orange Flag cost 16 Bahts (35 cents) flat rate for the trip. The boat arrive every 30 minutes. The stop for Wat Arun is Ta Tian (Tian ferry dock), you can simply tell the cashier when you go to the ferry dock and they can help. Once you are on the boat, just tell the usher, they are very helpful. So, from Ta Tian, take a short walk to the next pier from crossing river, take a ferry cross to Wat Arun. This one cost 5 Bahts. You\u2019ll love this trip. It\u2019s a great experience. The boat is never crowded and Thais are very friendly.  Hope you enjoy it.",

I took the MRT to Bang Phai station,  Exit 1, and then down the stairs or with the elevator, it takes about 15 minutes to reach the pedestrian bridge over the canal, and then to the grounds of the temple. There is the Meili Caf\u00e9 near to the bridge, good espresso and brownies. \nThere is so much to see at this temple, of course the giant Buddha statue is the main object for pictures. From the pagoda which is behind the Buddha pictures of the area can be taken. In the pagoda there are several levels to climb up the stairs, definitely worthwhile to do. \nSeveral foreign women walked around with very tight shorts and bustier, unfortunately the Thais are too shy to tell them that wearing such dress is very disrespectful.",

Wat Paknam and Wat Paknam on the Bang Luang River are names that began to appear in historical records in the late 18th century. Paknam means \"lock in canal\" and refers to the location of the temple. Later, it was practically abandoned and interest in it declined. In the first half of the 20th century, it was thoroughly renovated and became widely known. This is a great merit of the abbot - it was Luang Pu Sodh. From a temple with only thirteen monks, he turned it into a thriving center of education and practice. The place is now famous for promoting Dhammakaya meditation, and monks and lay teachers are engaged in it. Activities also include charitable causes such as educational, construction and many other projects.\n\nThe temple is beautiful and each of my visits to this place brought a lot of impressions.",

It\u2019s also a large temple complex that you wouldn\u2019t expect to find so near to the infamous Patpong. The complex has idols of Hindu, Chinese and Buddhist deities, including Ganesha, Amitabha and Maitreya. Much of the architecture of the complex is typical Thai, except that the ordination hall is one floor up and accessed via a double staircase, where you can also see a giant sculpture of Garuda on the facade. Inside the ordination hall are murals with deep intense colours of blue and burgundy after entering past doors with beautiful mother of pearl inlaid doors and window shutters.\n\nThe high altar has a golden statue of the Buddha seated and calling earth to witness. The buddha is seated on an unusual curved throne on multiple tiers, with each tier having a different design. \n\nOne notable service provided by the temple is the Ruamkatanyu Foundation. This foundation provides burial services for those unable to afford funeral services. A truly worthy cause.",

Tucked away amidst the humming cityscape is a temple that quietly beckons with a unique call to generosity \u2013 the act of coffin donation. \n\nThis temple, a serene oasis, has become my unlikely pilgrimage site. Here, away from the skyscrapers' shadows, I participate in a tradition that honors life by supporting the journey after it. The coffin donation is a profound gesture in Thai culture, an offering of dignity and respect to those who have passed away without the means for a proper farewell.\n\nEach trip, I find my way to the temple gates, where the metropolitan bustle gives way to a tranquil courtyard. The sign pointing to the 'Coffin donation' reaffirms my purpose. Inside, I'm greeted by walls lined with names, each representing a soul whose departure from this world was eased through the kindness of strangers. \n\nMy contributions here are small, humble threads in the larger tapestry of communal care that this foundation weaves so diligently. But the impact, I've come to realize, is immeasurable. In Bangkok, among the temples and tuk-tuks, I've found a place where I can leave a piece of my heart, contributing to a cycle of giving that reverberates with the enduring spirit of humanity. \n\nThis tradition has become an anchor of my Bangkok experiences, a meaningful counterpoint to the ephemeral joys of travel. It reminds me that amidst the transitory nature of life, there are enduring acts of kindness that define our existence. And so, with each visit, I embrace the poignant beauty of this city, not only through its sights and sounds but through the silent giving that echoes in its heart.\n\nPlease note:\n1) Write your name on the pink slip of paper to be pasted on the coffin of your choice\n2) Receipt is to be burnt at the temple connecting the donation centre after you make your wishes, do not bring it back\n\nAddress:\nWat Hua Lamphong\n\u7fa9\u5fb7\u5584\u5802\n728 Rama IV Rd, Khwaeng Si Phraya, Khet Bang Rak, Bangkok 10500\nNearest train station: Sam Yan",

They change sheets after each massage and offer fresh clothes to change into for massage. The lady massaging my friend offered her slippers to my friend whose shoes was broken  which was a kind gesture but for massage it is a big NO! Not worth the money.

Inside, however, was somewhat of a letdown. The images of Buddha and altars were rather simple and the rooms themselves somewhat bare and cold. This is an old temple - having been renovated in 1796. There is a beautiful wooden building that is part of the complex - it is a museum for the temple. The temple\u2019s location is set within the Samphanthawong District - part of Chinatown.",

The temple was built during the Ayutthaya period (1351-1767). In later years, it was restored by King Taksin (1767-1782) and he named it a royal temple. During the reign of Rama I (1782-1809), a bell was found there and moved to Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha). In the old tripitaka hall there are beautiful and precious Thai paintings. In addition, the Tourism Authority of Thailand supported the idea to include Wat Rakhangkhositaram in the \"Respect to the Nine Temples\" campaign along with other similar places in Bangkok such as: Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho, Wat Arun and others. Amazing temple that makes a big impression.",

Touching them, seeing them up close scratching and washing themselves and then stroking them made for a memorable experience.\n\nWe got some great photos and videos when inside the cage and enjoyed the short time we stayed here.\n\nThe place is smaller than I expected. You arrive at the entrance, choice what size tiger you want to see, pay around 1000 baht per person (depending on what tiger size you actually choose) and then go to queue for your time to enter the tiger cage.\n\nWe spent around 10 minutes inside the cage and there were 3 of us. We were able to have photos with 2 of the tigers inside the cage and the other 2 were in the pool area.",

Pichai once fought the Burmese invaders with two swords, one of which broke during the bloodletting, though he and his forces still won.\nHe is known as Dak Hap or Broken Sword.\nThere's a chedi which may contain some of his ashes, and a building containing statues of him.\nThough I am as atheist as a toad, I was and remain moved by the dead Buddha, perhaps because I've been to countless temples in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Laos, and Myanmar in which the living or near-death Buddha is glorified, but here, he is simply dead.",

I am particularly drawn to its unique architecture and tranquil ambiance. Notably, the large white stupa, surrounded by a cloister with Chinese-style structures, is a standout feature.\nThough it is free of admission, you can walk around and inside the stupa. I found artifacts displayed inside interesting.\nThe temple started construction in 1828 and completed construction in 1855. Its stupa was destroyed by thunderbolt later and eventually got fully repaired.\nBefore reaching the stupa, a small gallery offers pictures and information, providing insights into the site's history.\nWhile this site is not as popular as others in Bangkok, I definitely recommend visiting here. Since I was the only visitor that day, I found this site quiet and beautiful. It gives me adequate time to calm myself down and being able to appreciate everything it offers. \nJust plan it into one of the city walk stops and you will be amazed once you get there. The authenticity, historical significance, and the sense of calm it provides compared to more crowded tourist spots would make your stop at this site worthy.",

If you are travelling by boat, heading towards Wat Arun/Wat Pho/Grand Palace, you will notice it with a white stupa on the west of the river bank before reaching Wat Arun. Do not miss the opportunity to enter the stupa if you are given one. You will need to climb up a narrow and steep staircase to enter the stupa. There is a park beside it which is equally worth a visit. Inside the park, there is a three cannons monument, erected as a memorial to a tragedy that caused 7 lives and a few casualties. The very first modern surgery in Thailand was performed in this very temple as a result of this incident by an American doctor.",

Therefore the Wat is dedicated to Buddha by the three of them, symbolized by three Buddha statues with different postures.\n\nRemarkable are the murals in the ordination hall.\n\nAdmission fee for foreign tourists is 100 baht, if someone is around to collect the money. Keep in mind that some Buddhists strongly object to ask money for visiting a place of meditation. Free admission for Thai. \n\nAs for all Wat visits: dress properly i.e. long pants, no naked shoulders.",

It is located along the west bank of the Chao Phraya River. Entry to this site was free.  There are sign boards, illustrating its history and significance. The place was not crowded. The architecture of the temple is the classical Thai style. The pagoda here is white. There is an ordination hall and some monastic buildings.\n\nThe place was quite warm, therefore carry a hat, sun lotion and water. We spend about 30 minits here.

Though it is not big in size but the architecture& landscape as well as painting on the inside wall of the hall about King Naresuan's battle on the back of elephrnt is worth to visit. Very few people on weekdays so u can appreciate the meditation or the pray on Ur own. The outside wall of the Ordinal hall has a Sag line architectural structure to make the Hall itself look resemble to a ship which carried  the divine King  to Heaven, which is one of the common architectural building back then in Ayuthdyaya stays when this temple was first built. Nearby is a famous restaurant called \"Kuey Taew Pak Wan\" . Strongly recommended for both the temple and the restaurant. Do not go to restaurant near lunch time-too crowded.

The grounds contain a sal tree, a nice wooden manuscript library and a chedi, which may contain the vestiges of an older Mon chedi.\n\nHowever, the main drawcard here is an 11th century black stone statue from the Haripunchai kingdom. It goes by various names but it is perhaps best known as Phra Sila Dam, the Black Stone Buddha. It is now enshrined in the vihaan in front of a huge seated Buddha. The statue is now completely covered in gold leaf, so do not expect to see a black stone statue. It is worth coming here to see this antiquity.",

It'll be somewhere around $50. Negotiate the price before leaving. They'll wait for you in the car park at the temple. It's best visited just before sunset. There are great views out over Chiang Mai. The temple is beautiful and lit up at night. The sun sets quickly so you get both views. The monks chant around 5.45 to 6. You can listen and see from outside but are also welcome to join them in the hall. I visit every time I go to Chiang Mai. It's busy during the tourist season, much quieter when it's raining. Even when it's busy, I find it very peaceful.",

                "text": "At the outset, it must be noted that Wat Phra Dhammakaya Temple \"is not a tourist attraction,\" as we were reminded on our visit.  That said, the place is astonishing in many aspects and visitors interested in learning more about the temple and Dhammakaya meditation are warmly welcomed.  We tried to call in advance for information, but no one answered the phone, despite repeated calls... strange.\n\nAt the left as one enters the main compound, there is an information station that will register visitors and arrange for tours (which reportedly can also be booked in advance online).  A transport will then be arranged to take visitors to a welcome center, where an introduction to the temple is provided.  Visitors on tours are required to be dressed entirely in white, and if necessary are provided white pull-over pants and shirt at no charge.  Free tours of differing lengths can be provided, with English tours of 90, 120 or 180 minutes available.  The day we went, we were the only ones on the tour at the time we were there.\n\nA golf-cart type vehicle took us around the massive compound (more than 300 hectares, with some 150 buildings) to see many of the structures and we were given some of the history of the Dhammakaya story.  The temple is reputed to be the largest in the world. The main feature of the compound is the Maha Dhammakaya Cetiya -- the huge UFO-like dome-shaped stupa, adorned with 300,000 small, gold-colored Buddha statues placed on the outside of the structure and another 700,000 inside (we were not taken inside the stupa).  \n\nSurrounding the cetiya is the \"Meditation Square\" -- an open paved plaza that can reportedly accommodate 400,000 people.  Further surrounding the square is the Grand Meditation Stadium,\" which is a massive austere two-level structure a kilometer on each side, that can seat 600,000 people.  At 5:30 p.m. each evening, there is a \"lighting ceremony\" after which the main cetiya is brilliantly lighted, giving it a glowing golden appearance.  Well worth seeing.\n\nThe Dhammakaya movement is shrouded in controversy, which is beyond the scope of this review.  Suffice it to say, the controversies result in some evident underlying tensions that exist in the form of tight security in some areas of the compound and subtle defensiveness of staff when discussing some topics.  The penchant of the movement for strict discipline has led some to make comparisons to Nazism, a point that is brought further to focus when people are bizarrely informed that the main cetiya and other structures in the compound have been \"built to last at least 1,000 years\" (echoes of claims of the durability of the Third Reich?). \n\nWe were not unduly pressured to give donations although donation boxes were conspicuous in many places throughout the compound and we were informed that merit is constantly running out (akin to water flowing out from a leaky pail) and needs to be constantly replenished (presumably, most readily through generous donations).  Quite dubiously, we were given a plain envelope at the end of our tour and urged to put a donation in the envelope that would then reportedly be given to the temple \"in the name of the international centre staff\".  Seemed particularly odd.  \n\nThroughout our tour, our photos were taken at several locations (we were given the opportunity to deny their use in the temple's social media at the start of the tour) and the tour guides repeatedly said that copies of the photos would be emailed to us.  Unfortunately, more than two weeks after our visit, and after several reminders, we still have not received the photos.\n\nIf you don't want to join one of the tours, it's also possible to enter the compound with your own car or taxi and proceed to the Maha Dhammakaya Cetiya and the Meditation Square.  Many visitors, in fact, go there everyday in the evening and walk around the cetiya (one round takes about 15 minutes).  Visitors on their own are encouraged to wear white, but are not required to do so and many do not.\n\nOverall, this is a very interesting place, steeped in mystery and intrigue, as well as highly impressive from architectural, religious, and meditative perspectives.  Obviously, anyone interested in learning more about the Dhammakaya method of meditation will find it particularly relevant to visit.",

The museum also focus on \"Phuan people\" which settled down in this region for a long time.

This well-maintained place contains an outstanding 57 metre tall Laotian style square-shaped white & gold pagoda that enshrines Buddha's relic (chest). The original pagoda is believed to be built between the 7th - 9th century and is considered to be one of the oldest pagoda in the northeastern region of Thailand. However, the entire pagoda collapsed after several days of heavy rainstorm in August 1975. Thus, the Thai public subsequently made considerable donations to rebuild the pagoda (which took four years to complete) to its original splendor, as we see today. There are several more structures on the temple complex, including an ordination hall and a number of Buddha statues.\n\nThe pagoda looked stunning in the night. We felt delight while we were walking 3 times in clockwise direction around the pagoda to pay respect.\n\nDon't miss this site. If you've never been to the place, that means you never really visit Nakhon Phanom.",

If your ride stops you at the carpark, remember to head inside where the main buildings are. Do your research and you will know that the real monks here wont approach you, IYKWIM. Another impt note is that, theres absolutely no English here, everything in Thai. Only the lady at the counter uds a little English and can point to you where you want to go.

                "text": "I had done a lot of research before going to this temple to get a blessed sak yant tattoo by one of the monks, expecially by Luang Pi Nunn.  I had previously gotten a sak yant tattoo by an ajarn in Chiang Mai.  My friends and I hired a taxi driver from our hotel for 1000 bahts roundtrip from Bangkok.  We left Bangkok at 7:00 am and arrived about an hour later.  Upon arriving, our driver asked someone at the temple where to get the offering, which building to go, etc.  There were a couple of different tables that sold offerings, one charged 75 bahts and another one charged 60 bahts.  After that, we were led to sit on a stone bench where there were 4 women waiting before us.  Interestingly enough, one of them spoke very good English and told us that we were at the right place.  About 15 minutes later, we were led upstairs to a building.  Right away, I felt something was wrong because I read from other posts that upstairs are for foreigners to pay large sums of money to get a sak yant tattoo.  Sure enough, once we were led upstairs, we were given a menu with all the different sak yant tattoos that they offered.  We were then told that the tattoo fee started at 4500 bahts and up depending on the pattern that we choose.  Well, I knew right then and there that we were led up to the wrong room.  After asking a couple of questions, we were told that there is another building where the monk does the tattoos.  Right away, the English speaking lady who were there before us tried to convince us that where we were was a better option because there was no wait.  But that's not the reason why we went to this temple.  So, I went downstairs to the other building to investigate.  Sure enough, Luang Pi Nunn, was in the middle of giving a tattoo to someone with about 5 people waiting.  After what I saw, I immediately went back to the other building to retrieve my friends.  As we left the upstairs room, the 2 ladies (one who spoke good English) followed us downstairs.  I thought, ok, may be they are coming to the other building with us.  Well, they left and was nowhere to be found.  A few days later, I thought about the event and I realized the English speaking lady must be part of a scam at the temple to bring unsuspecting foreigners upstairs to pay for the very expensive tattoo.  \n\nNow that story is out of the way, let me tell you the steps.  Once arrived at the temple, find the tables that sold the offerings.  Then find the right building where the monk performs the sak yant tattoos.  The room is located on the ground floor of a building.  So, if you were led up a bunch of steps, run the other way unless you want to choose your sak yant and pay an arm and a leg for it.  Once you find the right room, you need to make a 25 bahts donation on silver platter in the middle of the floor.  You will also put the offering you bought on that platter.  Then you will find a stack of pink envelopes (very worn because they are reused).  You'll then put a donation into that pink envelope, find a place to sit on the floor and wait for your turn to get tattooed by the monk.  The rest you can just watch and learn while you wait for your turn.  It is important to remember that the monk determines which sak yant and its location on your body.  There is no pictures allowed inside the building and please be respectful to the process.  The tattoos that we received were done with a tattoo gun.  Just because it wasn't done with a stick doesn't take away from the power as long as you show respect and be a good person.\n\nGood luck to you all!",

The Ubosoth is huge with beautiful (and in relatively good condition) Buddha\u2019s history painting on canvas starting from the left of the Buddha image. Above the canvas paintings, there are also framed paintings telling the history of the Emerald Buddha. In the front of the principal Buddha status is a small and ancient Buddha statue in black called Luangpor Saen. We were told that it was built ard. 1710 in Southern Laos which look quite different. Next we went to the Viharn (Prayer Hall), at the back of the Ubosoth, to see the golden Buddha of Sukhotai period found out abt 60-70 years ago when the plaster outside was cracked, this Wiharn is sponsored by Xuto family.",

The parking area is quite large so at this stage of construction no issues in finding space.  Food & beverage is available from several shops with adequate shady areas.\n\nThis Wat reminds me of Disneyland\u2019s Magic Kingdom offering fairy-tale lighting, dragons & mythical beings.  Whilst it is still under construction there is no shortage of curio stalls, not only at the entrance to the Naga cave but within as well.  Whilst we were there 5 bus loads of young, well behaved students arrived and we noticed that their phones were working overtime taking a myriad of photos.  It confirms a suggestion that it is a learning center for Buddhist history in the making.\n\nThis \u201ctemple\u201d is not my idea of a facility for worship but as an \u201centertainment\u201d or educational area it would work quite well.

The dragon theme is obvious but there appears to be a handsome Hindu warrior who may be the Buddha as a prince or a shape shifting personage related to the dragon.  Anyway the Thais seem to love it all and come to do their reverential ritual acts, buy lottery tickets and eat and drink. It's all kind of a Thai Buddhist day out. \nThe sculpture work and the casting of the Buddha in a ceramic looking statue were impressive enough but it seems rather secular to me and the garish lighting reminds me of Chinese caves.  But maybe entertainment, laughter and colour are the way Thais approach their Buddhist way of life.\nNot that easy to find, even for Thais (follow the inexact GPS?) and some distance from Sisaket city. I see there is also a beer bottle temple in Sisaket province, for a double fantasy adventure.",

I guess this is the way a monastery should be, but reality it makes a very crowded meditation center, with few private kutis, so a lot of people are squeezed in each communal kuti. Although the kutis are very convenient and each floor has its own 2 private bathroom and showers, and each one has ceiling fans, the more people squeezed in a kuti, the harder it gets to sleep and meditate. \n\nThis place is very welcoming to foreigners and beginners, and so the atmosphere is not strict. They allow you to choose whether to keep silent or not and they allow using phones as long as it is both in silent areas. They are very soft in the discipline, which requires the meditators to be in self discipline. I would say, this works for locals, but less with foreigners who are not used to worshipping idols, minding the surrounding of the others etc. \n\nForeigners have to understand that this is mainly a monastery of Thai culture, and so they require women to sit at the back in the meditation hall. This is the buddhist Thai culture, and foreigners must accept it, otherwise they will just feel frustration. \n\nTo me it was the first meditation center experience, and it was good, however due to the overcrowding of the place, I couldn\u2019t find enough peace of mind to meditate so I had to leave ealier than planned. It was also a good place for me to learn the local culture of the Thai people.",

Only to learn from another monk that that it was completely not true and the ritual was for something else entirely. Initially he was cold and dismissive when I visited but as soon as I donated to the temple and him he became very warm...\n\nWhen I found out I was basically scammed, I left immediately; The abbot there was irresponsible and didn't even meet me after I ask to meet with him to talk about the problem. He was quite friendly though when I initially donated 2000 bhat to the temple just to speak to him. I spent 7000 bhat in traveling cost, 9 hours of travel from Chiang Mai, and around 3 days memorizing Pali for a total experience of nothing except that I now know monks at this Wat are unscrupulous liars who only want your money.\n\nCenter is pretty badly run, the check in was run by a volunteer who didn't speak english.

The exhibition is on junior level, with low level of educational nature or maybe better to say with the purpose to entertain the visitor and not to educate. It is more for students maybe.

It was very interactive as well, which made it more fun. There was a video in one room and a puzzle in the other.

It's just behind a mall (Central at Rama IX, if I'm not mistaken) and is accessible via the subway (It's more accessible than Google Maps suggests). You can go around the entire place in less than an hour if you don't stop for anything. \n\nThe stalls are mostly food stalls and they have the usual Thai dishes but some stalls have more exotic options (octopus, worms, scorpions, etc). I liked the mango sticky rice and the various coconut products. There are some stalls that sells merchandise. \n\nSomeone was complaining in a review about Chinese tourists and while there were some when we went there, it wasn't all that bad. \n\nThe place is clean. The toilets looked like portalets but there's a mall nearby so you can got there for cleaner bathrooms. \n\nThis is the perfect place to go to if you're in Thailand for a conference and only have night time to explore.",

There was a good mix of food, drinks, souvenirs and clothing.   Although it was crowded there\u2019s adequate space in the alleys not to be pushed around.  A couple of downsides was how difficult it was to get a taxi after.  No one would put their meters on so you end up layover the odds.  Also the place where we chose to eat (right in the centre of the market) didn\u2019t deliver all of our order and if we hadn\u2019t checked the bill properly would have paid for a bunch of stuff we didn\u2019t eat.

NEVER BUY JOINT TICKETS. This is the fourth time I've been stranded for over 24 hours in a strange city, missing my pre booked hotel, bus, or private taxi, or ferry. You would think I would have learned from the past three experiences, but this is the last time. If you ever have a connecting train, you WILL MISS YOUR CONNECTION FROM DELAYS. Save your money and buy a plane ticket. The trains are old, and derail constantly, very dirty, and are never on time. I sincerely highly recommend taking a plane, unless you have a minimum of 24 hours to waste. And when their trains are late, you get no refund on top of it. ",
