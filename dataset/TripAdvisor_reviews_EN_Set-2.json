                "text": "This place is currently only known to Thai tourists, and has been steadily gaining attention on social media over the last year since it opened. It is apparently an enterprising venture between several villages to create an attraction to bring tourism into the area, so you have a market built on a long bamboo corridor on the water's edge, where one side is filled with lotuses, which no doubt would look spectacular if in bloom. Various bamboo constructions were made, including a 4 story tower which gives a view of the surrounding area, and boat rides can be hired to travel a little way down the river. \n\nIt's pretty much set up to enable people to take a lot of selfies and is very instagrammable, if that's your thing. The market itself is rather sparse, and is more akin to a village market rather than the glitzy polished versions found in the capital. Being new, the place can be difficult to locate and get to without a smartphone, as signage is rare. At the moment, it seems a little underdeveloped, and might have more potential given time.",

I would say there are about 40 food places to choose from mostly Thai but a few Western choices, plenty of seating and sometimes music when the band feels like it. I had a rather good hamburger that even had caramelised onions, my Thai wife had mala (super spicy) bbq and wasn't so impressed. Cheap and not nasty. Worth a try especially if you like sitting outdoors.",

Not so crowded and doesn't have that much incense stick smoke. The main sanctuary contains big buddha image , quite impressive while the side Ubosot ( chapel) and small sanctuary were also well maintained , the painting inside both building are great . \n\nLast but not the least, you should ring the Thailand largest bell ( 193 cm diameter, weight 13 tons) at the bell tower for good luck. \n\nParking space is great, only 20 Baht fee.",

There were still plenty of rides for them to go on. If you have small kids I believe taking the option with the water park is a must. It as really hot & going into the water park a total breather. There are slides for all sizes. Keep in mind that you need to rent apart the donuts for the river. It was pretty empty (we went on a Friday) so we didn\u2019t need to wait a lot in lines as it usually happens on this parks. Keep in mind that you must bring or buy swimming suits if you want to go to the water slides. The park is not well maintained (that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t give it a 5) is pretty old and could do with some painting works in some areas but in my opinion it didn\u2019t lessen the fun!",

                "text": "The Siam Tulip is known as the Krajiew Flower. The park is basically a foot path along the slope of a mountain where the flowers seasonally bloom. There is a festival associated with the blooming and the tour buses arrive in mass. The park is large so you really don't get a sense of how many people are there except at the entrance. For those who like to trek the festival is accessible without a tour bus or car. At the foot of the mountain leading to the park is a bus stop. There are usually a couple of young men with motorcycles waiting at the stop (motorcycle taxi) to ferry people to the top. The trick is to hire the driver for a couple of hours to wait while you are in the park so they can take you back down. There is no regular transportation provided by the park back to the bus stop. Advanced trekkers can figure out a way down but novice find themselves panicked a little. The Thais are very gracious when approached politely and 400 THB will solve most of your problems when trekking.",

She comes from generations of captive bred animals and would find it hard to survive on her own in the wild natural habitat.\n\nWe also would like to explain about how our elephant is taken care.  It is one of our top priorities to make sure our elephant is happy and healthy.  We provide her with good quality of life: she can roam free, play and engage in activities that she enjoys, such as mud bathing.  Our mahout has experience more than 20 years with elephant.\n\nThe veterinary who is experienced in elephants come in twice a month to check her health and give medicines, if necessary.  He will write report every time and his reports say she is healthy.  \n\nThe time she needs to meet our guests is only 2 hours daily.  We keep distance between her and the guests.   She is used to this type of environment\n\nThank you again for your concern.  We guarantee that we do not practice animal cruelty.",

Cute performances by everybody especially the romantic couples showing the bartering system.\nGood that they banned the videos and mobile phones as we would be missing to see the real show.\n\nBooked the dinner as well with them.

I loved that it was close to our hotel and its connected to the BTS Siam Station, staff are the friendliest. My favourite part is the entrance on the G Floor, it was so nice and beautiful. The Gourmet Market is the best market it had so many products and it is a must for your next visit to Siam Paragon. A good restaurant in Paragon is MOZZA by Cocotte.

From riding an elephant (up to 2 persons for each elephant), taking photos with elephant while its lifting you, riding the horse, watch the monkey show, etc.\n\nFirst things i do here is riding an elephant. The elephants here looks so old, and when i ask the rider, he said that Hong Nam (our elephant) was already 40 years old. But she's still strong. You will ride for about 10 minutes, and at the middle of trip, the driver would offer to take your photos using your camera. Don't forget to give him some money tips when its done. *grin*\n\nWhen you done, you'll find ur photos taken by the local photographers, and if you want to buy it, you only need 100baht. So cheap i guess. Then you can try to take ur photos while the elephant lifting you up. Butttt, the elephant looks so poor. Its eyes looks so tired. Well, it broke my heart actually.\n\nSame goes to monkey show. Although the monkeys really smart to do what the trainer want, but it will make you feel the sadness when you see how they treat them. With steel choker around their necks, the monkeys will definitely feel hurt! I can't stand myself to see that show for more.\n\nFor important note for all of us, i would remind you that the toilet is bad. It smells, dirty, and disgusting. I would definitely not go there anymore.",

After that there are many species (50+) of snakes to view including massive boa constrictor types. I'm not a great snake fan but was still interesting to view them all and seemed to be well kept and generous tanks/enclosures. \nWe were able to handle one impressive python and several smaller snakes in the cafe area and staff were knowledgeable and friendly. Even though we were the only visitors left at the end of the day, they still put on a small snake show to demonstrate handling techniques.\nThe only downside is the location, probably too far out of the city for many tourists to bother making their own way there and it was very quiet on our weekend visit.",

Take Bus 519 and tell the driver \"Talad Naam Kwan Rian\".\nAfter alighting , you will need to walk about 300m to the market from the main road.

There you can pay 150 Bat more per person to ride in a paddle boat for 30 minutes and stop at various craft and food stalls. Ours was a slow day but the boat traffic was still almost as bad as Bangkok. You do not need to bother with the paddle boats, as you can walk the market from the inside.

The main entrance you can hop on to a free motorbike sharing ride to the market. Through out the sheltered market there are overhanging pipes expelling mist to keep everyone cool. Even the toilets is air-conditioned.\n\nWhat we discovered was there are animals in captivity much like a mini zoo, goats, Llamas, miniature ponies, prairie dogs, tortoises, swans scattered around the area. Quite a sight really, but of course there are eateries along the stretch of the river, where you can savor boat noodles & seafood.\n\nOnce you are all done enjoying the sights here, you are on the way out, you can once again hop on to that motorbike where a friendly guy will gladly whisked you out to the main entrance where you can catch a taxi back home.",

These markets, known for their vibrant atmosphere and unique boat-based shopping, offered a deep connection to Thai culture. We explored the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market, where narrow canals lined with stalls and wooden houses bustled with activity. As we glided along the canals in a long-tail boat, we encountered vendors selling tropical fruits, handmade crafts, and souvenirs, all from their boats.\n\nThe floating market was more than just a place to shop; it was a lively community where vendors, many of whom had been there for generations, greeted us with warm smiles and offered samples of their goods. The highlight was the incredible variety of food, including refreshing coconut ice cream and a delicious lunch at an open-air restaurant. We also enjoyed bargaining for unique souvenirs.\n\nVisiting a floating market in Thailand is more than a shopping trip\u2014it's a journey into the heart of Thai culture. The market\u2019s lively atmosphere, friendly vendors, and delicious food made for a truly memorable experience. If you\u2019re planning a trip to Thailand, a visit to a floating market is a must-do, offering lasting memories and a unique glimpse into a preserved way of life.",

I brought my family to here and regretted. \n\nBe careful of VAN scam, where the driver will bring u to the boat port, and intro u the boss(owner of the port) u have to buy the boat package to tour around. \n\nFirstly, goids are too overpriced 3x4x than Chatchuchak (which are already pricy). \n\nSecond, the floating market lost its charm and authenticity compared to years ago. It just became one big tourist trap. \n\nThird, travelling to there is way too long and at least 1-2 hour and if u get stuck in Bangkok\u2019s traffic jam, it will be longer. This means it\u2019s better to skip this nonsense and enjoy the night markets and the shopping malls here. \n\nIt\u2019s just not worth it anymore. I\u2019m angry I got scammed with my family at this tourist trap. Fked up place and ruined my day.",

Once you reached there's a lady selling their package for 4 of us like 6000 baht and add on 2000 for a add on temple visit but this add on was just a 15 mins to 20mins riding no where in river. Reached a place then still need wait for our car to the temple so we decided to call off as we are so tired.  They will keep selling stuff on side of the stall at a higher price than bangkok city. Also, they took a picture of us and show us at 500 baht which really turn me off at start. So when I said expensive,  he said 400 baht so we had no choice to take as I don't know what they will do to us cos we on their ride. It was really super bad experience for us and felt cheated like on pirate ship. ",

It\u2019s definitely further than you think and the hour and a bit promised was nearer 2hrs to get there.\n\nThe boats are priced per person not per boat and for a family of 5 therefore expensive.  \n\nThey choose which market stalls to two you to and the price of the (very standard) fare is significantly more expensive than any other market but the chosen enjoyed the experience.  This is a way of life that has obviously died out (you pass a Costco on the way) and is therefore kept alive just for tourists.  The water quality is poor and other than a glimpse of a kingfisher absolutely no wildlife at all.  The waterways are mostly quiet but on the main \u2018street\u2019 it was very busy and the air quality from all the engines very poor indeed. \n\nProbably not worth it with some dubious animal (exploration) add ons that we declined.\n\nThe railway market was worth a visit on the way home and everyone was waving to the passengers as the train came and stalls were rolled up.  Not worth a visit on its own but broke up the journey home. \n\nProbably should have passed on this but the kids had an ok day out.",

For Muslim tourists, I think this place is suitable for those of you who want to try Halal Thai food. Apart from food and drinks, this place also sells limited quantities of typical Thai souvenirs.\nThere are many interesting things about this market, such as traders divided into several areas, some sell in kiosks on the mainland and some sell on boats on the Toei river. Sellers who sell on boats have a unique way of delivering their wares to buyers. They use a piece of bamboo or wood to deliver the customer's order which has been put in a plastic bag.\n\nKhong Hae floating market in Thailand which is considered as the first and only floating market in southern Thailand.\n\nTo the west of this market, there is a confluence of two rivers and to the southwest is Wat Khlong Hae, a Buddhist temple painted in gold.",

                "text": "We went to the floating markets on our first day in Bangkok. We were not yet used to the money. When we arrived there, a lady came straight over to the car, brought us in and sat us down and started to throw a lot of different options at us of what we could do, before we had time to stop and think about the extortionat prices they were charging, we were signed up for a package. As a couple we each paid 3000 Baht for what I can only describe as the most tragic boat ride. So 6000 Baht for the boat ride which doesn't include any guide. We later check online prices and we seen one for 780 Baht. After travelling for an hour to get there we felt so hard done by!\n\n Also worth noting was that one of the packages they offer is photo with a chained tiger and elephant riding. We also witness snakes in boxes ready to take photos with tourist. Cruelty at its finest. Do yourself a favour, avoid these markets and save yourself a fortune!",

The food court is very reasonably priced and most of the food is excellent.  \nI see lots of negative reviews, and I suspect those people had no idea what they were getting into..  Be aware of what you are going to.  Jodd Faris market is much more family friendly and cleaner, etc... but they don't have much of this sleazy aspect.

Food and drink is not an issue, though you are not allowed to carry your own drinks inside.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s an ok day out place, though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the price.",

Souvenir is still ok, most of it in the entrance.\nThere is a few cafe around the region as well to rest your tired feet.",

                "text": "Would not recommend going to this park. We pre booked tickets online the day before which was pointless as we still had to line up in a large line to pick these up at the park. We had a ticket for the marine park, safari park and a buffet. I think they are about 1000 baht each. If you want to go to the safari park for some reason this ticket is entry but you cant go in unless you pay an extra 100 baht each on the day for the bus in. I dont know why they would not include this in ticket entry as you can not go in without paying for the bus. The marine park is where pretty much everything is so if you go probably just get a ticket for that. There is lots of animals to see in there, albeit they look depressed in their tiny cages. The animals have very small enclosures. The buffet was not good. I wouldnt bother getting the ticket with this included. There is a lot of cafes around the park so I would eat there instead. \n\nUnless you have a lot of time in bangkok do not go. Its an expensive depressing rip off.",

                "text": "Last year, I visited Khlong Bang Luang with my friends. It was an easy trip and filled with good memories for all of us. It was quite convenient to travel, so we hopped on the MRT to Bang Phai station. However, since the Artist House is located in the middle of the village, we walked around 10 minutes more to get there. This part can be confusing for a first-time visitor. If you don\u2019t feel like walking, the other way is by motorcycle taxi at the entrance to the side street. And if I remember correctly, it would cost around 15 baht. (I recommend this way better if you are a newcomer.) \n\nWhen we arrived, it was a little bit smaller than we expected. There were several shops open for tourists, but not all of them were on weekdays. We were there early that morning. So we had no problem with overcrowding, unlike on weekends. There are several activities for us to do. For example, feeding the fish, painting on a canvas, learning how to make gel candles, and various handcrafts. If you are interested in artistry, you can buy many beautiful souvenirs from this place. We decided to spend our morning and afternoon painting some pictures and beading bracelets at the artist house while admiring the view of the canal with the long-tail boats passing by. \n\nOverall, the experience at this place was pleasant nonetheless. If you are looking for some artistic gifts alongside a peaceful canal, then Khlong Bang Luang Artist House might be a great choice for you!",

It's located on the edge of Bangkoks largest slum area and if you walk off the main road then you can see the housing at the edge of the market and how people are living.\nThe market itself is for the locals and you may not see another European whilst in-side.\nThe meat and fish area are not for the faint hearted and watching a trader skin live frogs/toads was an experience to see. My daughter was keen to move on and see the vegetable selection after the live chickens were also being killed to order.\nPersonally I would not eat from any of the street vendors nearby as the hygiene standards are too low.\nIf you are from Europe /US and have a comfortable middle class live style and are staying in a 4/5 star hotel in Bangkok then this is great leveller to appreciate what you have and why we have nothing to complain about!",

You find plenty of street food and it is as good as at any other market, many locals are eating here, this usually means that the food is good.

Their silk products look superb. My Thai friends who didn\u2019t join us did find the smell from the klong ( canal) overpowering.

                "text": "Dahra Spa is an absolute gem - if you are looking to relax in the heart of Bangkok, it doesn't get any better than this.\n\nLast week I was in Bangkok to visit a good friend who had recently started living in the city as a digital nomad. I was keen to find somewhere that could provide a great massage both to untie some knots left over from the flight and to just relax and enjoy my holiday in general.\n\nAfter some quick Trip Advisor and Google review research, Dahra Spa looked the part - close location (Silom Branch), extensive menu and great reviews. I booked myself in for an hour treatment, a Royal Thai massage.\n\nOn visiting, I was very impressed with the facilities and the service - the receptionist was very organised and welcoming, the waiting area was very comfortable and the overall vibe of the place was incredibly relaxing - no mean feet after you step off the busy streets of Bangkok in Silom.\n\nI was asked if I had areas I wanted to focus on, areas I wanted to avoid, medical conditions, pressure levels etc - it was a very thorough and professional experience.\n\nThe massage itself was excellent - the first part was very relaxing and targeted to the areas I wanted to focus on, so lots of tension in my upper back, shoulders, neck etc (typical desk worker). Pressure was great and the therapist regularly checked in to see how everything was feeling.\n\nThe second part was very much the Thai Massage experience, with a lot of manipulation into different positions, stretching and massage. It can seem a bit intimidating at first, but the reason it works so well at Dahra is they clearly know exactly what they were doing - where I was stretched, moved and massages, everything was done within my limits and without causing any pain or discomfort.\n\nI walked away feeling lighter and more comfortable than I had felt in a long time - an absolutely wonderful experience. I cannot recommend Dahra Spa enough. Prior to flying out of Thailand, I booked a second massage, and it was every bit as good as the first.",

You also see a lot of people selling balloons I don\u2019t exactly know what that is though. All the bars are free to enter but there is this one particular bar that you need to pay to enter and that bar was banging. Keep in mind that there\u2019ll be a lot of people pulling you towards their bar so the choice is yours.",

We suspect the atmosphere might be much different (and more lively) at night.  But like other similar areas around the world, we foreigners are seen as walking ATM machines.\n\nIt is impossible not to notice that cannabis shops dominate the street by a wide margin.  Anticipating the Government's intention to ban these for general use, several have changed signs to say \"medical\".  But it is also hard not to wonder what can replace them if they close.  There are soooo many.\n\nAdvice:  just don't even think of going there in the morning.  And public bus 2 or 511 snake their way through the city and are a cheap way to get in and out.",

However, my last visit to Bangkok (12/2018) the sleeper car was sold out... so i opted for the adventurous standard seating.  NEVER AGAIN!!   The trip was still fun and adventurous, but after 12 hours of just sitting in a seat and not being able to LAY DOWN... it gets old quick.   Then you are burned out when you get to your destination.   I highly recommend this station and the trains for the experience.  But, for a long haul trip... PLEASE get a sleeper car!!",

Mosquitos and diesel soot! \n\nYes, at 310 baht per person its inexpensive, however it will be one of the worst decisions you make. The seating is 2 abreast bench style and after 45 minutes your legs will be sticking to the vinyl, your backside will be aching and that\u2019s merely a taster. A couple of hours in, the constant screaming, screeching and loud rattle of the train will be unbearable; you may decide to take a walk down train to the buffet car but beware, the doors of the train will not be locked and you\u2019ll see them slamming back and forth in the slipstream - extremely unsafe and un-nerving. Watch those younger children or over adventurous teenagers. Anyway, you make it safely to the buffet car and opt for the 190 baht dinner special of orange squash, mini spring rolls, rice and oily, unappetizing looking mystery meat topped with obligatory greasy fried egg - absolutely awful and a scary proposition. We ate a few scattered mouthfuls and spent the next couple of hours in the hellacious confines of our 3rd class carriage expecting to urgently require, but praying that we\u2019d be able to avoid the urine splattered, stinky, revolting, crouch down facilities. \n\nIn summary: \n\nAbsolutely to be avoided. Entirely without merit. Not an adventure, an absolute misery!",

                "text": "We have just tried to book tickets on Sleeper Train 9 Bangkok to Chiang Mai.  We sat up until 2.30am our time (8.30am Thai time) which was when tickets for our date went on sale,  pre-logged in to Thai Railways website as we had heard tickets sold out fast.  They certainly did.  Site wouldn't let us in until 2.32am by which time ALL 1st class cabins & 2nd class berths were sold out on Train 9!  How is that possible when all seats, in person and on-line should go on sale at the same time?  We have managed to get 2nd class berths on Train 13 but they are all sold out now too by 3am (9am Thai time).  My advice is to book with a Thai agent who will take non-confirmed bookings 90 days before travel.  It looks as though they are given preferential treatment, even though they also cannot buy, in theory, until 30 days before at 8.30am Thai time.  When we looked initially every site said you couldn't reserve until 30 days before and by the time we found that agents were taking bookings earlier it was too late and they were not taking any more bookings for our travel date in early November 2023.  We are still looking forward to our trip and there are some very good reviews for both trains but our preference would have been first class and I am puzzled that Thai Railways don't invest in more sleeper trains as this is obviously a very popular service.  Will review again once we have experienced the train journey.",

It is a market for local residents.\n\nChinatown is also recommended for shopping catches but neither could we find anything worth the name of \"catch\" or \"bargain\" so I wouldn't either recommend it for shopping.\n\nHowever it still is interesting to walk around the booths a stores and see something different.\n\nThere are many more attractions worth your time in Chiang Mai so unless you are there for several days I wouldn't make it the purpose of any day.\n \nI have attached several pictures, hoping to give kind of a feeling of this place.\n\nActually I would recommend a better use of your time there: a Massage break (especially an aromatic oil massage) to relax from long day walks.\nPerfect break to continue visiting the Old City.",

Prices are fair and bargaining is expected, especially for multiple purchases. \nIn the second block, there are two food courts, one on each side with cheap and delicious foods. The left one is in a wat- about 30 food stalls, with tables to eat and some higher end crafts. Quiet, compared to the street.\nWe go early and try to look before the crowds come out. It gets very tight and it seems as if everyone is going the opposite way. There is no pedestrian traffic plan. If you see it, buy it, because it\u2019s hard to find things later!",

The Market Sells a whole bunch of stuff, this street is open every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, in downtown Krabi. The walking street gives a platform to local artists & vendors to showcase their products to the tourists. The Krabi walking street is great for spending a few hours, passing through gifts & eatables but expect a huge crowd & slow navigation in the most popular market of town. There are many street food vendors and you can buy tasty thai street food, such as grilled Satay & PadThai in low price. After buying food, you can sit in front of the stage & watch live acts while enjoying your food. I ate Durian for the first time in Krabi Walking Street.",

As the name suggests, you need to walk down the aisles, there is no other option to experience this market.\n\nType of shops: Clothes such as stoll, shirts, jeans etc, food such as dried fruits (not dry fruits), sea food, fresh fruits/shakes/juices, shawarma, corn, cococnut ice cream and souvenir shops.\n\nPayment: Almost all of the shops accept ONLY cash. Very few were accepting payments via digital modes such as QR code. I was not able to spot shops accepting credit/debit cards. So make sure you carry an ample amount of cash (Thai Baht)\n\nParking: Ample car/bike parking is available along the outskirts of the market. I am not sure whether there was any dedicated parking lot. But everyone was parking along the side and this was free.\n\nEntertainment: Live music stage has been setup right in the center of the market with numerous tables where you can grab a seat to enjoy the food and music.\n\nThings to keep in mind: \n-No washroom facility so you need to smart enough to enter the nearby established outlets/supermarkets and (maybe) make a purchase before you are allowed to use the washroom. \n-Sets up only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday that too in the evening/night. So you need to plan your itinerary in advance to cover this.",

At night more of these open and alot were preparing for high season. \n\nThe island doesn\u2019t have many bars or a huge focus on night life or partying which is lovely. It\u2019s just about the turquoise water, diving, snorkelling and eating.\n\nThey are trying hard to preserve there natural resources, although nearly everything has to be bought into the island. Considering this it\u2019s still not too expensive. \n350Baht for a massage though.",

Otherwise my opinion is extremely negative, the street smells bad, in some areas it even makes you want to vomit, rubbish everywhere, dogs mostly badly treated walk down the street hoping to get food or affection from a tourist, an almost unbearable sound at night coming from the bars. The street itself is narrow for the amount of people passing by, I noticed that many tourists walk down the street barefoot, then find it strange to contract mycoses and other infections.\nThe massage studios are usually small rooms without windows or light, I felt a bit suffocated in some that I visited",

Everything you need is on hand, the people are so friendly, prices fair, massages plentiful and reasonably priced. Was a bit worried after Covid that it might be too quiet, but most things open and a lovely atmosphere. Highly recommended. Wander off Walking Street and it\u2019s beautiful, parts reminded me of a Disney film set, stunning! \nEasy to book ferry for onward travel.",

Engaging in snorkeling and kayaking activities provided a firsthand encounter with the park's vibrant coral reefs.\n\nThe challenging trail to the viewpoints demanded physical exertion but rewarded with a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The opportunity to reach elevated peaks and absorb the breathtaking scenery was undoubtedly a highlight.\n\nThe clarity of the water, visibility of coral and fish, and the overall stunning views underscored the park's natural magnificence. \n\nFrom the pristine beaches to the emerald lake, the park itself stands as a must-visit destination.",

I must have had the look off a confused tourist as an elderly fruit seller pointed in the direction of what I assumed was the temple. After buying some fruit I wandered off in that direction and after 5-6 minutes the temple appears out of nowhere. It does appear lost in its position. The ticket booth is set off to the right hand side and after paying the 100 baht ( for which I would have been happy paying more), I wandered to the bottom of the stairs past a gazebo abbled to show your tickets , but no staff were present.  After walking up the stairs with clearly labeled directions I reached the top where there are ample racks to take off your footwear. There was a lift for the less mobile. I was there mid afternoon, and although hot and humid, it was not very busy.\nYou are able to walk round the Budha to appreciate it from all sides but I still could not  comprehend it was solid gold.\nAll together an interesting visit that you should allow 30-60 minutes to appreciate the site.",

They took you through small lane in Bangkok and cross the river by ferry to the other side of Bangkok.  Only a short part was on the road but staff always look after us. I must admit that I've never been to this floating market before although it is so near.  Lot of things to see and lot and lot of local foods to try.  \n\nThere is an optional boat ride at floating market (approx. 60 Baht).  The ride is about an hour where you can explore life along the klong of this unique city.\n\nEnough for Bangkok trip this time and now gotta go back to Phuket.",

Boat ride 100 baht for about 45 minutes. Lots of local items. Bought 1 kg coconut sugar for 50 baht. Huge market need at least 2 hours to go through. Pretty clean. We ate prawns, sausages, octopus, noodles, etc. Definitely worth a visit. The boatman even let my grandson drive the boat, with his guidance of course.",

When you look from the entrance of this market you might see that this market doesn\u2019t have many shops and not that much, but when you enter inside there were many shops inside there and many alleys that can make you lost in the market! By the way that was an amazing experience for me to visit this floating market and it is not similar to those other floating markets in Thailand as other markets have the canal through the middle and have shops in left and right side of the canal but for this floating market it is different that you must visit once. Moreover, I recommend you hand make pork balls with Thai spicy and sour sauce because it is so delicious that I want to enjoy eating it again.",

After exiting, you will find motorbike taxis waiting to pick up passengers. Tell the rider you want to go to \"Talad naam Ban Nam Pheung\" and he will bring you to the pier to take a ferry. The ride costs 20 THB. The ferry will bring you across in about 5 minutes. Then, you pay 6 THB when you disembark. You will see a lot of bicycles and you can rent one.

Beautiful Wat, monks, shrines and entire surroundings were glorious and serene. Respectfully wandered about admiringly until we reached the back and saw large Buddha up another staircase which at this stage we were not wanting to climb. It was so hot and humid with no air but we did climb.\nYou can truly appreciate the mastercraftsmen and tradesman whom built these massive structures. The whole site is incredible. The views and the scenery are spectacular.\nMy husband and I were the only ones there apart from from a local woman and her young daughter in prayer. They left very soon after we arrived and it was a lonely feeling to be the only 2 people around the blessed site. Very peaceful and serene.\n... however, whay most probably do not know that behind the huge Buddha statue atop the stairs is a path that leads on and on. There are structures that get higher and bigger. The skywalk is also there as is Buddha's footprint and finally a large gold shrine. Buddhas footprint interior is still being completed with its gilded motifs and decorative paneling. We were blessed to be able to enter and the artists show us around. He said to date, its been 5 months of interior work; amazing. \n \nThe views are 360\u00b0 in some places. Spectacular! ",

Therefore, I was like, why not I take a close look?\nIt turns out that it is these unplanned encounters that often lead to the most memorable experiences.\nI later learned that this place is called Loha Prasat, literally means the Metal Palace, a multi-tiered structure made of metal, making it a distinctive architectural marvel. The fact that this site is often overlooked by the crowds makes it a true hidden gem, providing a peaceful retreat from the city's vibrant energy.\nThe beauty of the temple is eye striking, inviting close scrutiny of every intricate detail. The peaceful ambiance allows for a leisurely exploration of not only the Loha Prasat but also the surrounding structures, including the main ordination hall and smaller shrines. The well-maintained temple grounds, adorned with beautiful gardens, contribute to the overall charm of the site.\nA notable feature is the opportunity to ascend to the top of the temple, providing a vantage point for taking in panoramic views of Bangkok. This adds an extra dimension to your visit, allowing you to appreciate the city from a unique perspective.",

The one we were in was Thai life and history of the royalty. We got into some fake boat, a Disneyland type of experience that took far too long. Then you get a model of a traditional Thai village and further on some of the history of Bangkok. Lots of it for the obligatory photos and selfies. In the part about the monarchy we learn how wonderful this institution is and has been. Admittedly, like in every heritage you can be lucky, but all in all there was a bit too much praise. The tour takes two hours, I could have satisfied my interest in about 30-45 minutes. Entrance fee is 100 baht for adults, seniors over 60 are free. You gate an audio guide for explanation, but most of the written text is in Thai. At least the seasoned tourist does not have to pay.",

The voice was broken, the background music too loud. But the responsible guide at the second and third floor was fantastic. A very kind and thoughtful young man. He taught us so much about Thai culture and history. Plus he answered all of our questions. \u263a\ufe0f",

Though having been to Bangkok many times, this is the first time I heard of this. \n\nThe museum is modern and has various multimedia and interactive presentations on the history of Bangkok since 1782. Formerly called Rattanakosin, this is why the name of the museum. \n\nThere is a small cafe called Golden Coffee. Part of King Rama IX\u2019s initiatives for the growth and improvement of life of its people.  The library in the mezzanine is very cozy and has a small collection of English books about Thailand, Bangkok, royalties and Thai food culture. Very instagramble. \n\nThere are about 8 exhibition rooms. It is important to join the guided tour. I\u2019d have to say this is likely the most pleasant one I have had in my whole life. There are different staff taking through different rooms. We feel overwhelmed by their hospitality and kindness. And of course this is part of the Thai local culture. \n\nOn the 4th floor, there is even an enclosed observation deck where you can get an elevated view of the temples and surrounding nearby. We spent about 3 hours there.",

You will have to drive your own car or rent zoo's golf cart for 500 baht. In the blue zone, you can walk if you have enough time. I guarantee you'll be able to see all animals in no more than 3 hours. Even faster if you took a zoo's tram for 35 baht. The tram ticket last until 5pm. The zoo has an area where you can feed deers very close. There are wild monkeys that live in nearby moutain walking around, don't feed them and take a good care of your property as well. Don't leave a key at a golf cart. ***Very important, whoever come here by taxi should ask for taxi contact in case of returning from the zoo. There is no public transportation at the zoo, even grab won't pick you up.  I WARNED YOU!!! I saw a group of tourist who had to paid an eye watering price to hired a stranger to get them out of there*** One more thing, the bathrooms here are Thai style. There are no toilet flush buttons.  You have to fill the bowl with water and pour it into the toilet, do this twice and it'll flush. I'm so fed up with tourists who don't clean up. Also, the toilets here do not have toilet papers, you must prepare it yourself. Leave toilet paper in the trash can in the bathroom, do not flush it down the toilet, because the toilet will be clogged. Best of luck, enjoy the trip!",

Khao can offer mainstream cooking class but more importantly, they have great selection of dishes for serious amateur chef like me, who does not work in a restaurant.  For those who are more adventurous and curious about Thai cuisine, this is THE place to be.  From the assistants to the instructors, everyone there is super passionate about food and thai cuisine.  Our instructors, JC and Toey, both had been chefs at a great thai restaurant.  They love what they do and you can feel that through out the classes that they want us to love thai food and they teach us to cook like a thai!\n\nWe learnt to make common dishes such as Phad Thai, Satay, and curries.  But we made pretty much everything from scratch.  We made the curry paste with a mortar.  We tasted the curry paste as we made it, so we know what flavor we are aiming for.  We had the recipes but what JC always tried hard to teach us was what the \"flavor\" should be like because that is a better way to learn the dishes.  \n\nWe also learn to make some dishes that are not common in America.  We made many salads and seafood dishes that are commonly found in Asia and in more authentic thai restaurants.  Through cooking different dishes, we learnt about Thai cooking and Thai's way of  life.  It was just wonderful.\n\nJC is a great instructor.  She will always take the time to answer our questions.  She taught us the components and complexities of thai food.  She introduced us to all the thai ingredients and how to achieve the balance of the sweetness, saltiness and spiciness in Thai food.  Everyone at Khao takes cooking to a whole new level: Even the garnishes and plating are professionally done.  You can see from the photos.  I spend 4 days with them and I was in Thai food heaven!",

The cooking school is located of KhaoSan Road, fairly easy to find.  The teacher JC was great.  The class only had 8 people and the recipes I wanted to learn were covered.  The class started with some information about Thai cooking and then a demonstration  and tasting of the things we were going to learn to make.  Then we each went to our woks and were assisted in making 4 dishes - Tom Yum soup, Stir fried chicken with cashew nut, fried rice and green curry.  We also learnt how to make the paste for green and red curry.  \n\nI would highly recommend this cooking school.  Lots of great advise was given about substitutions for vegetables etc that you may not be able to get in your home country.  Looking forward to trying out these recipes at home now and with the training I got, I'm sure it will be possible once I find the ingredients.",

The instructor was so lovely and chirpy, and explained what each ingredient contributed to the dish and the history of Thai cuisine.

I was planning a recent trip to Bangkok and I decided to ask a friend that is a corporate chef for a major chain for reccomendations for a chef school in Bangkok. He reccomended Khao San. In looking at their website you will probably recognize several culinary figures here in the US and around the world that have attended the school. The school was founded by Kobkaew Najpinit and her daughter, Ning. Kobkaew is considered the godmother of Royal Thai cuisine. Kobkaew and Ning have been invited several times to lecture and present at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone here in the US. They have consulted on several Thai cookbooks by some of the best known chefs of Thai cuisine. I was very excited to get the opportunity to learn Thai cooking at Khao San. \nThe way the school is set up is you select 3 dishes that you would like to prepare. The ingredients necessary are assembled. Ning not only explains the ingredients and preparation techniques but also makes sure that she illustrates the history and cultural importance of the dish. Food is extremely important to the Thai culture. While Ning and her brother do an excellent job in the techniques of wok frying or grinding curry pastes, they particularly excel in explaining Thai culinary culture. Ning actually holds a masters degree in anthropology in addition to being a very good chef. The school is set up in the back of the D&D Inn on Khao San (or sarn) road. This area of Bangkok is kind of a funky, bohemian area of backpackers and hippies and worth a visit even if not attending the school. However, the school is very professionally equiped, light. airy and very clean. I know there are several more \"tourist\" oriented schools mass marketed in Bangkok, however if you want the same culinary training in Thai cusine that many of the most well known chefs around the world have gotten then I would reccomend the Khao San Cooking school.",

Once you make it to the top the Cafe seating has one of the best views of Pattaya and surrounding area. There are two temples, one of them sits next to a breath taking view point, have your camera ready. I visited in the morning (8-9am) and it wasn't too busy. I can only imagine it does get quite busy later in the day. Actually on a side note, planning activities early in the morning will help deal with the hot afternoon temperatures.  All in all, I would definitely make this a must see place when visiting Pattaya. ",

(August) Long boats, lake swimming, waterfalls, coral cave, kayaking, jungle hike.A private tour enabled us to tailor the activities and accomodation to make the most of our time and was definitely worth it. A family of 5 (18, 15, 11) we were so well looked after from the moment we were picked up at Jungle House. Leam told us so much about the history of Cheow Laan Lake, his own life, local flora fauna and wildlife so we felt we learned so much more about Thailand. He introduced us to some delicious Thai food along our journey - sticky rice and chicken and rambutans. Leam was a very warm, knowledgeable and amusing host. We stayed one night at prai wan raft house and loved swimming in the lake, kayaking, watching local wildlife. Amazing raft house accomodation. Leam looked after us on a waterfall walk and a coral cave walk...both amazing experiences, including the wooden raft across a small lagoon. You may be fortunate enough to see wildlife in the wild! This was the most amazing family adventure that we will remember and treasure. If you want to see this area of Thailand you will not regret booking a tour with Leam and Khao Sok Private tours.",

The boarding time can be really slow, & even though we arrived there at Asiatique The Riverfront around 1900hrs & only managed to find the check in counter at 1915hrs (Yeah, the place is really huge!), we are still able to board the vessel (Thank Goodness!), but had to wait like another 30mins queueing to do so. We booked for the Upper Deck tables (Which I would recommend), & the views are good. Took some nice memorable pictures along the cruise. Food wise I think is decent, not exactly top notch but good enough with some varieties. The staff were helpful & friendly enough, but I can tell that most of them were quite overwhelmed due to the large no. of guests. The entertain onboard was good too.  But ultimately, I think we're pretty lucky as the weather is rather kind to us on that night. I think it'll be kinda sad if we were to be met with a downpour on that night, as it'll be a real wet blanket for sure. So Best of Luck...",

They recommended it, so we tried it. \n\nWe took BTS from our hotel and got off at BTS Saphan Taksin station. The pier is right below the station as you exit. (Walk towards the river.)  On the far left of the pier is the Ticket booth for Chao Phraya Tourist Boat. We bought a One Day River Pass for 150 THB. They staple your receipt onto their brochure. (Don't lose it.) Soon the boat arrived and we got on. Since the weather was hot, we decided to sit \"inside\" the boat which was actually quite nice. It was open window so we caught the nice river breeze. We were going to The Grand Palace for our first stop. If you sit on the left side of the boat, you'll see ICON Siam and Wat Arun along the way before reaching The Grand Palace. They also make a pier stop at Ratchawong for Chinatown and Rajinee for Wat Pho and Museum Siam.\n\nAfter visiting The Grand Palace, we got back onto the boat and went to ICON Siam for lunch before catching the boat again to head back to Sathorn pier where it was an easy walk to BTS Saphan Taksin. On another day, we purchased another One Day River Pass and visited Wat Arun and back to ICON Siam. \n\nHighly recommend getting an All Day River Pass (peace of mind), especially if this is your first time to Bangkok.

They say this tour can take you to Asiatique Riverfront, but the only time it takes you is from 4pm, and based on their brochure there is no return trip from Asiatique, and it is hard to get the information from the staff if you don\u2019t speak Thai.

I chose to go there for a walk being bike less at the time.  The bike lane is interspaced with plants and benches where you can sit and watch the river traffic go by.  Its also accessible by wheelchair. There being a lift at either end. I was there in the middle of the day and the river views were fab. There's a ferry terminal (N6 Pier Memorial Bridge) nearby so its quite easy to access. Just a short boat ride  from Saphan Taksin Pier.  Underneath  the bridge is Phra Pok Klao Park through which you can access the skywalk. I meant to go back during the evening because its a lot cooler and the views were said to be better. Everything being lit up at night. (It was a bit hot during the day even with an umbrella)  There are public toilets in the park below the bridge. They were fairly basic. At the time I visited there was a layer of black mud (not all dry) throughout the building. I gathered it was from the recent floods and hadnt been cleared yet. All in all a good walk with some pleasant views.",

A lot of collections are displayed with an English explanation. This building also has 3 rooms that display the gold artefacts. And it is beautiful.

This too was free. Combined it was a great day and everything was free except the delicious coffee.  Thanks to the staff for your hard work we appreciate you!  The reviewer that wrote \"Don't go!

                "text": "This museum can only be visited as part of a guided tour group. Tours leave the reception desk every half hour on the hour and half hour. It is not necessary to book ahead, just wait for the next tour. The museum has some video presentations and exhibits covering the history of trade and of money. It is informative and not restricted to coins alone as the name might suggest.\n\nThe museum includes items from a pre-existing coin exhibition, now closed, that was previously located in the Grand Palace.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that the tour lasts only 1-1/2 hrs and is rushed. There is so much to see that an increase in length to 2 hours would seem appropriate. For example, there is one area with a set of coins of each denomination for a large number of the world\u2019s countries, maybe all, didn\u2019t catch how many. Children are encouraged to rush around stamping a souvenir booklet with images of the coins, which is fun, but adults don\u2019t have time to look at every country\u2019s exhibit. It is not allowed to circuit again to take in more of the exhibits without a guide. I suppose that\u2019s for security reasons. Could have spent more time here.\n\nAdmission is free and the tours are free.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the museum\u2019s stated opening hours are 10am to 6pm (Tuesday to Sunday \u2013 closed Monday). But, because admission is by 1-1/2 hr guided tour, the effective closing time is 4.30pm, possibly earlier \u2013 the last guided tour may depart before 4.30pm! To avoid disappointment, it would be advisable to go in the morning or early afternoon latest to catch a tour.\n\nConsider combining this with the Bank of Thailand Learning Center (TripAdvisor reviews at \u201cBank of Thailand Learning Center\u201d), which is open Tuesday to Sunday (10am \u2013 4pm), say one in the morning & one in the afternoon.",

There are several shrines dotted around the beautiful gardens, but the main attraction is inside the Erawan Museum hall which also acts as the pedestal upon which the statue is also surmounted. The giant three-headed elephant stands an incredible 29 metres tall and is visible from either of the aforementioned stations. The hall itself is also worthy of mention. It has a stunning staircase with the first level leading to a beautiful green statue of Buddha, then spirals up around the hallway. The top floor is more like a prayer hall representing the Trayastri\u1e43sa. The altar had an image of a standing Buddha in the foreground, while at the back there is a seated Buddha, guarded by Naga. The museum is located on the outskirts of Bangkok. \n\nThe closest stations are Pu Chao and the Chang Erawan BTS stations. It can be a pain to get to in the heat, but it\u2019s totally worth it.",

                "text": "Benjakitti Park is one of the most soothing places in Bangkok. It is located between  RatchadaPisek Road and Dumrong Pituk Road. There is a lake in the centre of the park, surrounded by green space which allows people to do activities. Since the place supports outdoor activities such as exercise, walking, and running, and allows art and music activities to be held, Benjakitti Park is truly the paradize for city people. Benjakiti Park is not just a normal green park because It contains four zones of forest which are different. Therefore, the visitors can visit several forests in one place. To visit around the park, the visitors can walk or run along the passageways which are arranged nicely. There are slow runways, fast runways, and bicycleways. Also, there are walkways through the forests which allow the visitors to perceive the forest's atmosphere, which is a unique point compared with other parks in Bangkok. The visitors should visit there after 5 PM because the weather is super hot and they can get burned by the strong sunlight of Thailand. Moreover, visitors can go there conveniently by taking the BTS Skytrain to Asoke station, and the MRT subway to Sukhumvit station. Apart from that, It is near Queen Sirikit National Convention Center which usually holds activities and special events. The visitors can continue their trip there as well.\nOverall, Benjakitti Park is a spectacular green park that is the heaven existing in Bangkok.",

The massage therapist was very good I only have problem with the receptionist.\n\nI called and made a booking with the receptionist, she  said they could accept 1.5hr booking, when I arrived they said they can only accept 1 hr because they need to save time for cleaning rooms. I was disappointed.\n\nAfter massage I asked for her help to get a taxi for me, she then helped to call Grab. After a few mins she said the taxi arrived and asked me to go down. She walked me down to ground floor and told me I cannot use the main entrance but can only use the entrance at the back. I was on my own and it was 10:30pm I did not feel safe using the entrance at the back, but I had no choice.\n\nWhen I reached the front street there was no taxi at all! After a few mins a taxi just came to me and spoke Thai. I asked if the Spa called him he just kept saying \"Yes OK OK\" so I got on the taxi. Then I received a call from receptionist asking why didn't I get on the taxi? I said well you told me the taxi was there but there was no taxi! And you didnt tell me the car plate number!\n\nI was very lucky that the taxi driver did take me back to my hotel in the end but he did not follow the route shown on Google map and I felt it was intentional. He charged me 200 THB, I asked hotel concierge they said 200 is too expensive should only be 120 THB. I then only paid 120 THB.\n\nCrap experience with the receptionist, I don't feel they take my safety seriously. Do not go to this branch - aged and worn. Go to Sukhumvit or Langsuan branch - they provide very professional service.\n",

Across the road along the east side of the park, there are many local restaurants (at the north end) and a whole row of massage shops (at the south end). Prices at these massage shops are lower than those near Central Plaza, so if you're on a budget you might consider walking over to this part of town.

It is shaped more a sword-like, like a few bayonets clasped together. .At a lower portion stood 5 statues, representing the formation of army, navy, air force, police, and civilian population. Unfortunately, there was gate and it was locked, also crossing over from either side of roads seems challenging so we did not manage to take a closer look.  Only at the overhead connecting bridge, onboard BTS and on the ground to admire the awe from a distance.

Street food, dessert, clothes, secondhand clothes and shoes, bag and accessories. Even I saw lots of foreigners, but this market is for local and resident. Because it's so close to tourist attraction, I believe people can communicate in English. I personally, enjoy so much shopping here!",

Almost no exhibitions of holdings (no display of national treasures, natural literature etc.); the holidings themselves are poor; entrance registration is a big deal (you cannot just go and see exhibits, you need to apply for temporary member status); there is no gift shop (usually National Libraries have great ones with good selections of books) nor a decent restaurant or cafe.

Collections include Thai manuscripts, stone inscriptions, palm leaves, Thai traditional books, and printed publications as well as audio-visual materials and digital resources. The library is a national information resource serving citizens nationwide.\n\nThe National Library has a long history. In 1905, three libraries, the Mandira Dharma Library, the Vajirayanana Library, and the Buddhasasana Sangaha Library, were amalgamated at the command of King Chulalongkorn the Great and renamed the \"Vajirayanana Library for the Capital City\".

The beach is lovely, beautiful sand and very clean. It's close to loads of restaurants and bars and gives you that proper holiday vibe. Everyone is friendly, from the cleaners in the hotels to the barmen and women, to the locals etc. \nYou can also jump on a long boat and visit other beaches along the coast, which is fun and cheap at 100 baht each way.

It was built on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River near the old Wichayen Fort which was later renamed Wichaiprasit Fort. The palace was called  Phra Racha Wang Derm (the original palace) after King Rama the first came into power in 1782. \nBecause of its strategic location, the King placed important royal family members in Phra Racha Wang Derm. This practice continued until King Rama V.\n\nI drove to the palace on Sunday at 9 o'clock,  it was easy for me to get parking space. There have been a number of visitors mostly Thai about 60 persons then, we were welcomed by the Navy brought us to Green house to watch a video in an air conditioned room to understand the perimeter of site. This took about 10 minutes, after that we were free to walk around. I could take some pictures showing the building and surrounding. It was not allowed to take pictures inside the building which had a large display of artifacts during 18th century period.\nOverall, it's quite refreshing and enjoyment for this visit.\n\nHurry up, you still have time to pay a free of charge visit until Dec 28th, 2019",

Even after that trusted members of the royal family resided here in order to keep this strategic building in the family. Finally, King Rama V made the Royal Thai Naval Academy here, with strict instructions to preserve the historic structures like King Pinklao's living wuarters, Throne Hall, King Taksin\u2019s Srine and Whale Head Shrine. The Academy moved from here in 1944. The building was renovated and currently it houses the Royal Thai Navy Headquarters. It undisputedly is a very interesting building. \n",

                "text": "The Royal Barges Museum is across the river from the Grand Palace. You can take a boat across, or you can order a Grab ride. We used Grab. When the driver drops you off, you have to wind your way around a few blocks worth of backyards and canals...it's a bit odd, but there are signs, so you'll get there. The ticket is 200B, and that same ticket gets you into the national museum.\n\nThe barges are incredible! So ornate, lots of gold. Dragons, naga, guardians---the decoration is super cool. Once you get there you don't need more than 30 minutes. But they're 30 really fun minutes.",

There is a European influence about the style of the decaying buildings here. An inscription on a boulder near the main gate tells us that the park was part of a royal palace built in 1866 and later (1960) opened to the public.\n\nLarge-billed Crows were moving about in the tops of the old trees and swooping down to feed on the scraps left by visitors. An Asian Koel was making the call which gives it its name \u201cko-el ko-el ko-el\u201d; these birds are known for their cuckoo-like behavior laying their eggs in the nests of another species of bird, in this case the Large-billed Crow.

There is also a park that is a garden groove as well.  For those who want to relax with family  or to exercise such as running  It's also appropriate.\n \n  For traveling to Sanam Luang 2, this is mainly to drive a private car.  There are quite a lot of parking spaces here.  but never enough to stop  especially during Saturday and Sunday  There will be a lot of people.  Expenses can be viewed at the arrival point when receiving the card.  As for other forms of travel  It will be a bus like 2 rows (written on the sign saying go to Sanam Luang 2) that can go up at the beginning of the line at Bang Khae Market.  It will come every half hour.  Or the bus line 91 (189 used to run in, but I'm not sure if it's canceled or not), but if you take a taxi, it's convenient as well.  Because there are quite a lot of taxis running to deliver passengers and take them out.\n \n  For the main zones that I will review  There are 4 zones together:\n \n  1. Tree zone is the zone where I come to dwell the most with my passion for cactus.  So this area I will know quite a lot.  The main ones that are there will be cactus.  From the low price to the ten thousand foot pedal, there are some.  trees  that both bloom and bear fruit make us happy  vegetable garden  Decorative plants, orchids and other things, which if you are a person who likes plants, you must not miss this place.  They also sell pots of terracotta, plastic, garden equipment, ornamental stones, and other things necessary to grow plants.  It's all here.  This zone is in front of Sanam Luang Song.  near the entrance  and inserted at various points as well\n \n  2. Pet Zone  Appealing animal lovers, including land animals, aquatic animals, and exotic animals here are also presented to choose from.  Although not as many as Chatuchak market  But here there are also pet supplies.  various animal feeds  that we don't have to poop to Chatuchak at all.\n \n  3. The food zone is a zone that exists throughout Sanam Luang 2, whether it is a restaurant, canteen, selling food for takeout.  Famous places have popular egg snacks.  If you come here, don't miss out on buying them as souvenirs.  Other food  For example, there are shops like Kim Yong Market to open here as well.  The price might be a little expensive.  But if compared to not having to go down to carry at Hat Yai up, it's worth it.\n \n  4. Second-hand sales zone  It is a zone that is located along with the front zone.  But this period is quite busy especially.  with a lot of salespeople flocking to sell  And the people who come to buy things will be clustered in this zone quite a lot.  There is a selection of everything from small items.  From Japanese crockery to wooden cabinets, display cabinets, and large items, there are quite a lot of them for sale.  Or it's a first-hand item at a very affordable price, there are a lot of them as well.\n \n  for whom to come  If second-hand goods should come on Saturday and Sunday.

I find pricing was extremely fair so I didn't haggle what so ever.\nI noticed elephant pants were 70B and although not my thing, it could be yours if looking for a cheaper deal.\nWe leave in 4 days so I will return again to buy some more little purses 10B each & more Thai fabric. \n\n",

And don't forget to check out the orchid exhibit, for sure the largest assortment of lady slippers I've ever seen in one place. The garden is huge, so even if there's a crowd you can still find a little spot of your own. When I was there, the treetop section was closed, so keep that in mind before making the drive, if your heart was set on that. Clean toilets at the entry and inside, and a small coffee stand and ice cream stand inside. Just down the road (short walk) are some food sellers and a handicraft section. ",

The 2 highest points in Thailand (Doi Inthanon and Doi Phahompok) are only big hills. There are roads going to the top. This is not the case with Doi Chiang Dao, it's true mountain there. \n\nIt explains why it's difficult to go there and why it's less busy. This is the reason as well why it used to be the favorite place of real trekking lovers. Unfortunately these last years it has been more and more complicated to explore the moutains there. The National Park has limited the entry to 4 months in the year then has closed the entry to the summit. It is now impossible to go to the highest point and inside the wildlife sanctuary.\n\nIt's a shame because it's a stunning area. Hopefully there are other trails around that few people and only one agency knows. I recommend to go there with them if you really want to discover Chiang Dao.",

The rain doesn't stop me. Those who know me, know that risks like these only increase my motivation to accomplish something. I did one day hike instead. You must have a guide to hike this mountain. The route is crazy! Thanks to my guide Tongchai Lungpong (you can find him in Facebook) preparing a pair of Phua Chu Kang boots for me. I don't think I can complete this route without one. I spent most of my energy shuffling in the nutella mud on my way up. I was lucky that the rain stops after 4 hours of hiking. The sun came up. Able to view the mountain goats from a distance and the most pleasant smelling flower such as pink lady and lavender. This is what I came for.\n\nAfter having delicious TomYam maggi cooked by TongChai. We continue our journey of 'The Only Way is Up'. The view up on the top leave me undone. We decent around 2:30pm it gets real dark while losing grip while trying hard to glue on the track. Luckily we prepared head light and torch. It's pitch dark and we found a few fireflies wandering around the trees. Landed at 10pm that sums up 13 hours. Off we go for steamboat instead of hot spring. Indeed amazing experience I had.",

Unfortunately it is a little bit difficult to find information in English in the internet, but our guest house recommended us Tongchai (+66 62 252 8349 for WhatsApp contact), a local guide from the area who speaks English.\n\nWe really had a great day and can highly recommend the tour for everybody seeking a more remote experience than the standard Chiangmai tours.\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to get to Chiang Dao (1 1/2 hour by local bus from Chiangmai) and the area offers a great experience of \u201creal\u201d Thailand.",

The park is at the north end of the city, and since traffic is as miserable as it is in Bangkok, it was not very convenient to reach.

I could hear several different bird calls. Moved on to the greenhouse area. Ten separate greenhouses, each displaying different types of plants. Impressive collection of carnivorous plants. Orchid house was a little disappointing, mainly because I've seen so many larger collections. Very impressive tropical rainforest display, the largest of the houses. After, had a coffee from the shop at the uppermost parking lot. Good coffee for 45 thb. Really wanted to hike the trails on the interior of the loop road, but I ran out of time and energy (steep hills!). Also not enough time for the natural history museum, which looks interesting. Recommend if you ride a scooter up here, you get a larger bike with disc brakes, as the roads are too steep for cheap bikes to descend safely. ",

Which ended up being much bigger than we were expecting. There was no entrance fee. You do have to dress respectfully. As I didn't think we would be going into a temple I had a dress on that didn't cover my knees but I could borrow a wrap free of charge so I could go in. The people at this wat were so lovely and friendly. Mostly locals & Monk's.\n\nWhile speaking to one of the locals we found out that Wat Chana Songkram is an important royal temple and it is an old second-class royal monastery built in the Ayutthaya era. Wat Chana Songkhram means \u2018victory of war temple\u2019.",

He was appointed as the 2nd King when his brother took over the throne then.\nThe title of the temple Chana Songkram means winning war, considering as a good name to commemorate the Siam-Burma war during that period. It was told that the amulet shirt from the 2nd King himself was kept inside the main buddha image of the temple. \nThe construction and design of this temple is unique and different from a royal palace style, locally we called this the art Wang Na ( front palace) style. For those who are interested in Thai art, you may also observe this at the National museum which was a former palace of the second king and at Wat Mahatat.\nThere is a special room dedicated to be a storage place of the second king descendants' remaining, this room has been closed and concealed to outsider in the past few decades. During my latest visit, I found that the room is now open to public. This is one of the interesting point to visit to see how the royal house keeps their ancestors remaining. Most of the royal family members remaining are kept in the royal palace and closed to the public. This is one of a kind and worth to visit if you stay around Khao san area. Check it out.",

We didn't have much time here, about 20 mins. I would recommend about an hour. Don't forget to dress respectfully. Shoulders and knees must be covered. \n\nIt started it construction during King Rama II time. He wanted it to be a tribute to his daughter. Hence why it means Temple of the Angels. It is famous for its architecture influenced by Chinese arts.\n\nThe great Thai poet Sunthon Phu, lived here during his monkshood in the early 1840's. His biography is shown at the museum that is dedicated to him on site. \n\nThere is lots of fun history here to see.

One part of it is closed at the moment for re-decoration which offers an opportunity to the visitor as for baht 100 you can buy a roof tile and record your/family name on the back \u2013 a practical and fun contribution as there is no entrance charge. The museum is made of lovely old wood, presumably teak, and the whole place is generally well maintained. Look out for the squirrels. ",

In the nearby pavilions, there is a collection of very old Buddha statues. But there is also a more modern addition, which looks like a Thai temple. By the way, the Thai temple nest to the chedi contains an incredible collection of Buddhas of all sizes.",

The building is cool, and the museum has some interesting exhibits about traditional crafts made in Banglamphu, old shops and stores, notable figures from history, and the historical timeline of the area.  Unfortunately, many of the exhibits are rather poorly prepared, with far too much tiny text almost impossible to read, and little coherence or flow among the exhibits.  It is confusing and difficult to find your way around the two buildings, upstairs and down, with no signage telling visitors where to go, and at one point forcing visitors to backtrack through the exhibits.  Apparently, there is also a Treasury Exhibition upstairs, but it was closed off the day I visited.  The day I visited, I was not charged an entry fee, although I think there is normally a 30 baht fee (for foreigners?).  All in all, most visitors can give the museum a pass, unless you have time on your hands and/or you are looking for an air conditioned oasis to cool off in.",

                "text": "I made a stop at this local community museum after i was not able to visit Bangkok national museum due to special event \" 237 years ceremony of Rattanakosin \", i was not allowed to park.  nevertheless, stopping at this museum was worth. I was impressed with the hospitality of security guard waving me to find good parking spot. This museum is funded by department of treasury, no wonder they could afford to provide A/C to the whole building. Entering to the entrance hall and met with a volunteer university students gave me the similar impression, they provided me a warm welcome and the visit was FOC. I was quite fortunate to attend a guided group tour at noon. Not so many visitors, 4, indeed. The tour started by telling us on the history department of treasury, their works and responsibility to the nation, followed by the history of the building which was build during King Rama 7th ( 87 years old) which were used as school for printing and was book printing factory. There were a few more rooms that guided brought us to visit, this area of Banglampoo in the past 60-70 years ago was more or less quite popular to youngsters similar to Siam Square of Central World nowaday. Some of the shops are still in business or change their product and services. After learning about these area by local guide, i could walk around and had lunch and tried special food for lunch in the area.\nBefore i left i could do some shopping on the commemorate coins , it is a good souvenir for either local or foreigner.\nSince English is not Thai's mother language, the volunteer guide might not be able to provide as good story as it should be. I would recommend foreign visitors to  pre-read about the place first before joining the tour either by group or on your own to understand about this place and the Banglampoo area. Overall it was interesting, i will bring my son to visit soon and wish Bangkok should have more community museum like this.",

The flow of tour is nicely planned. They even have the world\u2019s first minted coin from Lydia on display! They do a good job telling stories of Thai financial history. They really make financial language fun for all the people.\nI love how they put the museum in the very heart of the Learning Center. Cool idea. Old and new are blended in good balance.\nWalk the ground to admire outdoor space. Relax after the tour in the coffee shop.

What was supposed to be a short visit to a Wat onroute to the river turned out to be a 3 hour long meditation session.\n\nI came across this Wat online as was looking for somewhere peaceful to go - off the beaten track. After spending a month travelling Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - it's safe to say we were \"templed out\".\n\nBut this Wat was something else. All month long me and hubs talked about how we had visited many Wat's but not heard a single prayer. So this experience was definitely one to remember. \n\nWe follow the lunar calender, as do Monks and so were very pleased to be vising on full moon night. We arrived at 4pm and heard some ladies mic-checking and immediately got very excited that we were about to experience something spectacular.\n\nIndeed we did.\n\nWe were greeted (as the only non native attendees) by English speaking ladies of the temple and monk's, we were given explanations of proceedings for the evening and so made ourselves comfortable.\n\nI would certainly recommend this Wat if you are looking for somewhere to go that makes you forget where you are. Away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok. \n\nAn experience you won't forget (try to visit on full moon eve which occurs every 15 days). You won't regret it.",

During Songkran holiday, every building was open and lucky me, i could find a parking spot on April 13th, a Songkran day.\n\nThis temple was believed that it was built during King Narayana of Ayudthaya ( about 330 years ago), this temple became the first royal temple for Ratanakosin ( Bangkok) since it was restored by Somdej Pra Bovorn Rat Jao Mahasurasinghanat, a younger brother of King Rama I, who was during the same era promoted as 2nd king, aka, Wang Na ( a front palace). The architecture of the front palace is different from the architecture and design of royal palace art. From my personal opinion, it is difficult to say which one is better, it's just different. The Buddha statues were collected from all over the country and restored after Siam-Burma war end about 230 years ago. In the past centuries, this temple was restored by many kings and royal family. It is considered as one the important temple in the capital as a traditional Siam capital's temple. Mahatat means the remaining of the great person, the Stupa in this temple is storage place of Buddha's remaining, King Rama I and his brother remaining. It's worth a visit if you have a chance to stay in the area.",

The museum is off to the far right hand side of the complex.\n\nWat Manee Si Mahathat is very impressive, it is in excellent condition, very well maintained and worth a visit.  \n\nThe complex is on Highway 4 on the way to Phang Nga about 1.5 hours drive from Khao Lak and 1 hour 15 minutes\u2019 drive from Phuket.",

One would easily mistaken the grand statue for Luang Phor Thuad, another (much famous) Thai monk. \n\nIt was unfortunately raining when we made a brief stop-over. There were two beautiful temple building flanking the statue/building \n\nThe smaller building was worth a quick visit, It houses a few life-size wax statues of holy monks and religious figures. I respectfully prayed to Luang Phor Thuad who life-like statue sits at the central altar. Another pleasant surprise was a statue of Thay-choo-kong which is an extremely rare sight in a Thai Wat, To the Chinese, he is the guardian of earth (area).    \n\nOverall, Wat Manee Sri Mahathat is a beautiful Thai Wat worth a stop.  \n\nThere are many Wats if you chose to drive in Thailand. All wat is unique in its own way and worth a quick 15-30min stop-over. There also a micro chance you meet with the Wat's chief monk. Do ask for blessings. I never fail to do so.",

Everywhere you go there were Thais and tourists taking photos of themselves near the artwork. Entrance is 50 baht for tourists which i felt was not an issue.

                "text": "My wife and I went to Khaosan Spa tonight for a pair of oil massages.  This was our third massage in Bangkok, and although it was ok, it wasn\u2019t as good as the other two nearby on Rambuttri  Road.  The facility was clean and the people were friendly.  The massages were done on a table versus a mat on the floor which was nice.  The pressure and technique were mostly good.  My first disappointment was that we were told to keep our underwear on.  Boxer briefs don\u2019t lend themselves to an effective, flowing massage, especially an oil massage.  Next, our tables were together with curtains surrounding them.  This was fine, but our two therapists talked to each other throughout much of the massage.  They talked softly, but it still made it seem that they were not completely focused on their work.  We also had a couple of male customers talking very loudly in a nearby area, and although that\u2019s not the fault of the establishment, they could have been asked to keep their voices down.  Finally, even though I had a two hour massage, my chest and abs were not covered at all.  This was surprising for a full body massage.  Overall, I give it three stars.  It wasn\u2019t bad for an inexpensive massage, but it wasn\u2019t great. ",

                "text": "The Democracy Monument is located at the roundabout on Ratchadamnoen Street in the Phra Nakhon district of Bangkok. The monument commemorates the 1932 Siamese coup d'\u00e9tat that led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe statue depicts a palm leaf manuscript box containing the Thai constitution. At the top, two offering bowls were placed over a round turret made of copper - 3 meters high and 4 tons in weight. The constitution is symbolically guarded by four wing-like structures with bas-reliefs and tiny fences surrounding the monument. The wings are 24 meters high. This is also the radius of the base of the monument. This means that the 1932 coup took place on June 24.\n\nThe monument looks impressive and should not be missed when walking along Ratchadamnoen Avenue.",

From the Amari Buriram Hotel it was a quick GRAB to the traffic circle where this is located just south of downtown. Ask to be let out by the sidewalk on the southeast side of the traffic circle. this will put the setting sun in the background of  your photos. Also this is where a crosswalk is painted on road leading to the statue. its gonna be dangerous to get across, consider that. so be very careful and quick if you\u2019re going to attempt it. \ngood photos can be had where the GRAB dropped you off. Very cool site, just fantastic.\nA wonderful local lady I use as a driver could also take you there.\nKhun Oi 089 490 3654 \nShe\u2019s also an excellent tour guide, translator and negotiator, knows\n the area well.",

There are a lot of outdoor exercise machines: cardio and resistance (exercise bikes, cross-trainers, upper body machines, sit-up benches, waist trimmers etc). Also aerobics classes every day at 6am and 6pm by a professional fitness instructor with good technique and thorough stretching afterwards. The classes only cost just 20thb / 50p/ 0.65US$, even cheaper if you pay for a month. There are toilets, benches, grass areas, trees, shaded areas and refreshments. Also free parking with security. Definitely worth a visit. Be inspired too...",

Although his life was cut short a way too early of an age, it was his forward thinking ideas such as compulsory education and a democratic government that has helped shape the Thailand we know today. \nThe museum building, dating back to 1906 was once a Public Works building. The structure itself both inside and out is an attraction unto itself - obviously well preserved, maintained and refurbished. \nThere are three levels inside. They contain photos, mementos, artwork, clothing, furniture, etc. of the King and Queen. The story of his life is exceptionally well laid out in chronological order from his birth to his death. \nOf particular interest are of his travels overseas to learn about how other democratic governments operated and to see how expanding a country\u2019s middle class (at the time Thailand has virtually no middle class) played an important role in its success on the world stage. \nThe entrance fee is free. I spent almost three hours here - and saw only two other people. If you\u2019re tired of looking at temples and want a break from the heat, I recommend spending an afternoon here. ",

The architecture is very gorgeous and glamorous. Taking pictures at  Sri Mariam Man Temple is permitted only outside, inside the temple is not permitted. Many people visit this temple every day, especially on the weekends, so it is busy all the time. This place is famous in terms of love, affair, and fortune. There are many Hindu god and goddess statues for praying and worshiping. For example, Sri Maha Uma Devi, Ganesh, Vishnu, Sri Mahalakshmi and Sri Saraswathi, etc. I visited this temple six times. The reason why I visited many times is whenever I visited there, I felt calm and  peaceful. There is a stall selling an offering in the temple including 60 Baht and 100 Baht set. If you buy an offering from the stall, you will receive one god card as a souvenir.",

Yes, there are almost 10,000 people coming in everyday, but the priest is still expected to have the humility and humbleness with the worshippers coming to the temple.

                "text": "Came to this temple known as Wat Leng Noei Yi 2, with the first one located in Bangkok's Chinatown area.  We decided to check this one out as my friend said it was much nicer and more spacious than the one in Chinatown, and he was correct.  If you want to come here by MRT, you can and it is quite convenient.  Just take the purple line MRT all the way to the last stop called Khlong Bang Phai.  From there call a cab (there are plenty of them around) to take you to the temple.  It is only about 3kms and should cost no more than 60-70 baht.  By the way the MRT ride all the way from Rama 9 was 65 baht, so the whole trip cost us less than 130 baht one way.  It is a long train ride but a great experience to get to see Bangkok Nonthaburi areas.  I came to this temple which is famous for its ritual to wash away bad luck in certain years where your stars aren't aligned with the Chinese years.  So, being a pig in this year of the pig is one such year, according to the experts.  The ritual is easy to follow with written instructions also illustrated on TV.  You can then walk around the temple and enjoy the beautiful decor, but be warned that it gets really hot in the afternoon.  Worth visiting.  ",

                "text": "...off in the distance while I was at Wat Khao Noi, so I decided to make it my next stop. It was only about a twenty-minute walk between the two temples, and I had lunch at an in-between the two, run-of-the-mill outdoor Thai restaurant. The family there was kind of shocked and happy when they saw me; the place was empty and they probably don't get many foreign customers if any. I ordered Pad Grapow of course (man do I love that stuff) and got a big awesome meal that include kai jiaw (Thai omelette), rice, soup, and that great sweet basil stir fry dish with chicken - all very delicious, all very inexpensive at \u0e3f60, less than $2, wtf.  Wow, so I went to this what I believe Chinese temple and wow again. It's one of the most ornate temples I've ever been to; it's also one of the most colorful ones I've ever been to; it's certainly one of the most garish as well. Very different to say the least. Lots of different structures and statues and I just don't know what all this here would be called. I think there is an animal theme centered here with brightly colored statues of beasts of all sorts: rats, tigers, monkeys, lions,  a mermaid (animal?), elephants (of course), whatever. Look at my pictures. Didn't see any regular monks here though. Did see lots of other people (especially seniors) wearing mostly white clothing milling about, doing some work, doing nothing, eating, etc. I think this is a kind of a monastery or society where older or lonely or just have no-other-place-to-go people come together and worship, pray, chant, light incense, light candles - those kind of things. A couple of them talked with me. They seemed very friendly yet on the dawn of creepiness or something. I don't know how to explain. They looked alone, and lonely, dressed in white, with a kind of silent pathos about them. Whatever, I looked around for about 40 minutes, snapped some pics, talked with a couple of people, and now finished this review.",

                "text": "Wat Traphang Thong or \"golden lake monastery\" is located next to the Sukhothai eastern city gate. This temple was built around 14th century. The temple is located in the middle of a lake and can be reached via a bridge. There are many Buddhist statues and monuments there, but the master piece of the temple is a footprint of the Lord Buddha (created in 1359 out of dark gray stone). The Buddhist symbols of the week days are other interesting things in the temple. Each day has its specific statue in Buddhism. Wat Traphang Thong is the only active temple of the historical park  and some monks still live there. Every morning you can see a row of the monks in orange which are going out of the temple. The grounds of the temple are green, neat, tidy & lovely. A fresh food market with the same name is sticking to the temple. When you are in sukhothai, visiting of this complex is recommended.",

What I did notice is that some of the stuff here is slightly more expensive but not that bad based off of American standards. I didn\u2019t go down to any or the bars so I don\u2019t know about that.

The food stalls all offer identical menus, with each vendor eagerly trying to attract customers, but there's no variety in either the dishes or prices. Judging from past photos, it seems the market is now just a fraction of its former self. Instead, I'd suggest visiting Jodd Fair nearby. It's truly remarkable and offers a much broader selection of choices.",

My favorite was my very sweet mango shake in a tall cup for only 45baht. We also got a cowhide leather keyholder from a stall for 65baht with personalized engraving. \n\nAs most night/street markets, the set up is typical and the same.

Recently,  i read up about this Sai Tai Mai night market and decided to take a look.\nDidn't regret the visit once bit and in comparison to the more popular and renowned ones I have been, I must say I prefer this one.  Prices are cheaper since the locals shop there (didn't spot too many tourists) not too cramped and crowded. Quite a large night market and the merchandises were not exactly repeatedly the same as seen in the other night markets. From my observation the other night markets had many repeated stalls, after walking a few mins you see the same thing sold by the vendors in the next alley way or so (they probably rent several stalls in one night market).  For Sai Tai Mai, it has a wider collection of merchandise. I.e a pair of decent mens bermudas going at BHT89!  Ladies sleepwear silky cami lingerie going at BHT100.  I also spotted unique clothing and for plus sizes as well. Pre love clothing fans , there are also some pre loved stalls there to browse. \n\nJourney is about 30 mins approximately from the city area.",

Mr Pramote was very attentive and did an amazing job to customise the itinerary to meet our varying needs! Mr Pramote\u2019s spoken English is good and he was able to communicate with us clearly. Mr Pramote always prompt to arrive and always brought a smile with him! He took us to so many unique and stunning places in and around Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, we even managed to take a leisurely boat trip to Laos! We felt that everything was taken care of, we felt safe! Everything went beyond our expectations! My family and I wouldn't have had such an incredible time and fond memories without the help of Mr J and Mr P! Thank you for making our first Thailand trip so special and fun! We didn't want to leave!! Thank you \ud83d\ude4f ",

Please teach your staff about manners and how to talk to patients with respect. \n\nI was spoken to like I am a DOG by the dentist! I am not exaggerating!  I am absolutely in shock! I have lived in Thailand nearly 20 years and this is the first time I have been spoken to (shouted at!) in this way by anyone. I am especially shocked it was from a health \"professional\".\n\nI was polite and friendly (I am a quiet person). As soon as I entered the female dentist  gave me a disgusted look.\n\nEventually, after having her back to me for a long time she turned around and said loudly and sharply, \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?\"\nI was quite surprised but began to explain which is when she began shouting, repeating the same thing at me over and over.\n\nI tried to explain that i was experiencing but she would not listen and continued to shout the same thing over and over! OMG, I had no words left. I just wanted to get out of there. I am too polite and regret not shouting back at her and telling her she has no right to speak to people like they are dogs!\n\nI have been to CMU dental facility several times in the past and the staff are polite and many dentists are nice, but my recent experience has been SHOCKING and this dentist really should not be in the profession because she has NO IDEA HOW to speak to patients or people in general.\n\nI am already a very nervous patient in a dentist facility and she has made the fear even worse! I am embarrassed to say I left the dental facility in tears because it was really a shock. I thought that by going to a private university dental practice, that I would be given accurate helpful information but I did not think that it would involve treating me like dirt.\n\nI will now look for a different dental facility to help with my dental problem. A place where you are spoken to with a decent level of respect.\n\nCMU, please could you send your dental staff for customer care training and teach them how to properly handle patients. This is NOT OK. We patients may be able to handle a little curtness, but not to be spoken to/shouted at like we are animals.",

No tour on foot is allowed so you have to take the \"tour trolley\".  The campus is probably the most bland I have ever seen among all universities I visited (a lot).  It is mind boggling that someone would actually design a tour and provide a special trolley for it.  Read the review.  Spend your time elsewhere.",

Ake and Naart looked after our booking flawlessly and happily changed their listed itinerary to include a couple of changes that we asked for. Communication was excellent and the booking process was very straightforward.\nWe spent 8 days travelling from Bangkok to Chiang Rai in the delightful company of Peter our guide and Mai who did a fantastic job driving us.\nAgain I cannot fault the care and attention that both Peter and Mai gave to us and we had so much fun in their company. We got to see so much over the course of the trip and Peter was not only very knowledgeable about the places that we visited but also showed us \"real Thailand\" and we have come away feeling we have experienced far more of Thai culture and everyday life rather than just seeing the sights. Mai was an excellent driver and we will miss her smiles and giggles. I have travelled in Thailand a few times before and this was my partners 1st time and both Peter and Mai effortlessly adapted to our slightly different needs. Thanks to Peter and his patience, my Thai has improved from truly awful to almost passable.\nA small family company who deserve to be rewarded for the effort and attention to detail that they show.

At the time it was an important contribution to Thailand's modernization as it was made of solid steel and could be opened and closed.\n\nThe bridge survived the bombing by Allied forces during WOII, but only just. The Thai government only found out in 1947 it was deliberately targeted.\n\nYou can walk across on foot and for instance visit the Saphan Phut nightmarket on the other side.",

It was commissioned to mark the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Chakri Dynasty. Hence it is named after the first king of the dynasty Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I). In English it is called the Memorial bridge. The 678 m long metal bridge connects Thonburi with Phra Nakhon. It has two tall beige towers on each end which add a certain grace to the structure. The Allies tried to bomb this bridge during WWII but missed the target. I loved the look of this bridge which you see while traveling in the Chao Phraya Tourist Express.",

Everything from alligator to snakes, but lots of good traditional pad thai's, pizzas, burgers, etc... Something for everyone.\nLots of variety of stuff for sale, clothes, souvenirs, etc.  Good prices and you can bargain a bit.\nGood music, but not too loud.  Overall, a nice, clean, safe market.

The islands were full of bird life and the rock formations weren\u2019t camera shy. \nOnly thing was I hadn\u2019t learnt to scuba dive so couldn\u2019t experience the Whale Sharks and rays that had apparently been there the day before. \n\nThe National park normally is shut at this time of year but happened to be opened for a little longer\u2026 happy to say. \nQuite expensive and maybe in the high season it wouldn\u2019t have been as tough getting there. \nThere would probably be a lot more tourist boats too. We had  the place to ourselves. \n\nPrice will differ from boat companies. We went privately through our resort the Layana Resort & Spa Ko Lanta . The staff were beautiful and very professional. The trip went to other islands in the day which were just as lovely . \nRound trip 9 am to 4 pm so take some sunscreen and don\u2019t forget you sick tables in case it\u2019s rough. \nEnjoy",

                "text": "We\u2019ve been to Koh Samui many times, and so each time we come we try to do something or go somewhere new. A local recommended a visit to Nathon, the administrative capital of Samui, and the port town where ferries from the mainland arrive. From Chaweng, it\u2019s about a 45 minute drive; we took a taxi which cost 800 baht each way. The drive itself is interesting, passing through the countryside and various local towns along the way. \nNathon town itself isn\u2019t not really on the tourist circuit, but it\u2019s a good place for a stroll; blocks of old timber shop houses in various states of disrepair, one a green grocer, its neighbour a motorcycle repair shop, and so on. It reminds me of old Phuket town and has the same potential for semi-gentrification depending on the ongoing waxing and waning of Samui\u2019s fortunes in the post Covid world. The main attraction of Nathon is the nightly food market nearby the pier, and it is super charming. It feels quite local and foreigners were in the minority when we visited. We did a circuit of all the different stalls before selecting fish cakes (because I have them everywhere) and spring rolls, and a whole grilled fish. The fish cakes were great - they were the dark, leathery, mean variety, tasty, chewy and streetwise. The grilled fish was really, really good - fresh, flavoursome, perfectly cooked. Everything was super cheap. Drink options were pretty much Fanta or water. There are tables and stools to perch at while you eat.\nAfter dinner, we walked to the end of the pier and enjoyed the sunset, and also paused to watch a group of tourists attempt disembarking a dinner cruise along an alarmingly narrow and unpredictably wobbly gang plank. Luckily, there were no casualties.\nAfter that we had a Singha beer at a neighbourhood bar, and then went into a supermarket to load up on Thai snack foods (who can resist spicy lobster flavoured potato chips?) before meeting our taxi driver at the appointed time in front of the administration building.\nWe felt satisfied, sun-kissed, and a little grimy. Excellent.",

Shooting range - check, cocktail van - check, live band who make an appearance long after you\u2019ve got fed up and moved on - check. The prices on the food stalls looked very similar to restaurant prices, which is a bit disturbing.",

You'll find an excellent selection of fruits, vegetables, and seafood here.\n\nHowever, you should be aware that the prices are a bit higher than what you might expect in typical Bangkok markets. For example, mangos and mangosteens are priced higher here compared to other local markets.\n\nThe market is also a great spot for tourists looking to get a taste of Thai food culture. There's a wide range of Thai food products available, perfect for those who want to buy small quantities or pick up some processed foods as souvenirs. There's a food court as well, but it's worth noting that prices here are slightly higher than other local eating options.",

There are piles of fresh fruits and vegetables, massive bowls of freshly ground curry pastes - red , yellow , green. It is definitely food overload.

I attended as an adult, on my own and was really glad I came.\nYes there are cabinets with lots of different types of snakes but there is also a floor of modern well set up exhibits, explaining evolution, anatomy, reproduction etc. There is also a room with what to do if you are bitten by a venomous snake. The information on the effects of the body are very accurate and up to date with the impact of coagulopathy and endothelial disturbance.\nThe highlight is the 20minute live venom extraction demonstration in a specially built auditorium. The snakes used were a lot more frisky than I anticipated and I was amazed the handlers are not bitten.",

As we reached the island our guide told us not to hand feed the pigs but rather throw food on the ground because they bite. I begin doing so and another guide of the same company comes over yelling at me letting me know it has to be poured on a plate and then the plate placed on the ground. I understand cultural differences and language barriers so I wasn\u2019t upset at all by the yelling I simply said \u201cokay I understand\u201d and as I reached for a plate he continued to yell at me that I do not understand and grabbed my arm so hard that I had to yank it away. He then proceeded to repeat himself five times, still screaming and called over my actual guide and told him to explain to me what he had just yelled to me 5 times. And to make matters worse its evident they do not clean their snorkeling masks. One of the guests found gum in her breathing tube and mine was obviously chomped on. Overall they need to work on the customer service skills if they are going to work with people.",

It was quite busy there when we arrived as the morning tour group were still there.   When we boarded the boat, we were delighted to see that there was only about 10 tourists in it so there was plenty of room to move about. After a short time, we anchored off Koh Tan island for snorkelling but there was not a lot to see in terms of the coral / sea life. Perhaps there are better spots for snorkelling that could be considered?  Koh Mudsum (Pig island) was lovely and was not crowded so you could enjoy the beautiful scenery.  Plenty of time there to feed the pigs, wander around, swim and enjoy some basic food and drink if you wished to. The cruise home at sunset was lovely and the boat stopped for plenty of photos. On arrival back to the departure point, a lovely Thai buffet had been prepared which had plenty of choice and was of good quality. Overall, an enjoyable trip which I would recommend but it could be enhanced by providing a little more background  information about the Islands, habitation, what to look for when snorkelling, information about the pigs etc.",

                "text": "Unfortunately the most unpleasant tour we have had in South-East Asia so far. Throughout the whole afternoon there is immense lack of communication from the staff. You get picked up from your hotel as promised, but since they do not tell you anything you are left to wonder where you are going and how long it will take. After +1 hour in the minivan transfer you arrive at the pier where they will check you in and give you a very quick overview of the trip. Afterwards you have to wait another 30 mins before the boat departs. When boarding the boat you would normally get introduced to your crew and guide, but unfortunately not on this tour. After a couple of minutes you will arrive at the snorkeling spot. Again very little information is provided about snorkeling tips, background information on the area we are in or any safety guidelines. However the crew is very clear in one messages and that is that you would need to pay an fine of 1500 Thai Bath (as much as the costs of the entire tour) if you lose one snorkel set. Not to mention that these snorkel sets were of the quality of your local second hand market and where nearly falling apart. If you expect to see clear waters, beautiful coral and extraordinary fish, please don\u2019t book this tour. Visibility in this spot is around 1 meter, the coral consists of one rock in the sea with some dead plants and coral attached to it. It felt like we just got dropped on the middle of the sea since it was on the way to pig island. Where normally you would have time to snorkel for more then an hour, you actually get around 30 mins. Additionally the spot was quite dangerous since we were at open sea were the waves quite high. You risked to get smashed into the coral rock or worse a sea urchin. Again no information on safety was provided by the crew. After the short snorkel stop you head straight for pig island. Here you are dropped of again without any information on its history or rules. The island on itself is quite nice with pigs walking around the entire island and food available (50bth) to feed them. After a little more then two hours you will head back to the pier where diner awaits you. On the way back you will be asked to provide the crew with some well earned tips\u2026 The diner was actually one of the best ones we had on our entire trip and somewhat saves this tour with one extra star. However we do not book a trip for the good food, but rather a nice afternoon where we can see the beautiful nature this island has to provide and learn more about its history and background. If you are looking for that you better look for a different touring company. But if you are looking for an overpriced transfer to pig island then please pick this one.",

It's air conditioned. Inside there were several floors of lovely and interesting artwork, photographs -- plus small cafes, library, and shops (e.g. guitar/guitar lessons). There was a gift shop at the top floor and a few vendors selling postcards, paintings, bags, jewelry, books, etc. near the escalators. \n\nThis is a sort of place you want to check out if it's too hot outside (or rainy) and you don't want to go to another mall or be in a crowd. It was quiet with a few student visitors when we visited on a Saturday. We took our time visiting each floor and appreciated the art that was displayed.",

At the south end is a shade house with a nice collection of orchids and other tropical plants. Interesting that there's an edible garden as well. Toilets are clean too, a bonus.

Definitely sense slightly fresher air in the deeply polluted Bangkok.\nThis is my usual go to place for a 3-5km run during the night. The park is pretty small, 600m per lap, but better than nothing right?\nOn Sundays, i tend to go in the evening, and it is always heartwarming. Reason being, I get to see couples just taking a stroll/some families having bonding sessions/teenagers having picnic/etc. It's nice to see all these. However, the park is really too crowded then, to run. I gotta run in all forms to avoid humans along the way, ha!\nNonetheless, it's a great park to have in this relatively grey city! ",

But what can one say - this is a really excellent space for classical music; world level no doubt; think London, Rome, Tokyo.\n\nFor visitors, however, two issues: First, the social context is weak (this is rare for Thailand), i.e. the foyer is  not a nice mingling space; there are very few food and drink options; etc. Second, as reviewers have noticed, the best access is via MRT. But if you don't want to walk (the MRT stop is not integrated but a bit away), taxis or grab cars have trouble finding the right place, and pickup is a nightmare, as there is no obvious or designated pickup location.",

I would recommend seeing performances in the Main Hall as the premier site for concerts. The Small Hall is ok, maybe for other venues, but not my preference.  The acoustics of the Main Hall are super and the sound envelopes the audiance beautifully.  The Royal Bangkok Symphony Orchestra performs here.  The grounds are very relaxing and beautifully decorated with a Japanese garden, pounds and bridges.  The area also has other buildings dedicated to arts and culture, a museum, etc., but the site is mostly concerts, opera, ballets and musical performances in the 2 halls.  Eating options are limited.  There is \"The Street\" mall across the main street if interested.  You can reach the Thailand Cultural Center by MRT train getting off at the station with same name, exit 1 and walking,  but it requires walking around a wide corner and crossing a busy street, or by taxi.  Wheelchair accessible.  Ask for assisstance.  ",

Its architecture and design (Chinese pavilion with many Chinese lanterns and a carp pond in the middle) made us feel like we were in the mansion of wealthy Chinese in the era of Qing dynasty. My favourite thing is many short stories (with bas-relief illustrations) around the place that teach moral principles to their descendants. Museum zone displays the history of Chinese people (and their cultural) in Udon thani, while other zones are souvenir shop and cafe. \"Phing An\" cafe offers you Chinese tea, coffee, mantou (steamed bun with no filling), bao (steamed bun with filling). We also bought some fish food at souvenir shop to feed many carp in the pond. Moreover, walking through a beautiful Chinese garden in the back of the place will lead ones to an ancestor shrine. Many people worship this shrine for prosperity of their life.\n\nAbsolutely Chinese / No entrance fee / Worth visiting",

We brought our own bottle of wine, which they opened for a fair corkage fee.  It was exciting and unique to enjoy traditional meals on the floor, Lanna style. My wife and I were celebrating out honeymoon, and were given generous and thoughtful gifts. We cherish them and the memories we had at Old Chiangmai Cultural Center!",

On the first Sunday of each month there is a market in the different pavilions with stands reserved for retired people. There's plenty of varied food, a lot of textiles and handicrafts and the prices, in most cases, are very reasonable. Well worth spending a couple of hours there and getting a cheap meal into the bargain. The standholders are friendly and happy to talk. On the practical side, the market is open from 11 a.m to 5 p.m., there is free supervised parking and each of the pavilions is served by a ramp for wheelchair users. And one last thing - there is a pop band playing (very well) hits from the 60's and 70s.",

Though I found the stage is a bit small which can handle no more than 4- 5 scences, the sound system is ok. The only real complain is the rest room which is not enough and quiet far away - you have to go downstairs or down the escalator to outside thratre and have to shoe your ticket on the way back into the theatre. 15 minutes intermittent is not enough and you have to miss the first few minutes of the second half show. The intermittent shoud be extended to at least 20 mi utes or even 30 minutes to make sense for elderly to go yo rest room. The ticket csn be bought through \"Thai Ticket Master\" through the internet. The shows are mainly Thai but worth a try cuz sometimes we do not undetstand italian in many plays as well. Once in a while they would bring real broadway show such as CATS and others to the theatre at price range between 1,000-1,500-2,000-3,000-4-5,000, depends on the production. If u r member of some club u may get discounts such as Visa Ultima 15% discount. The show my wife and I went 4 this time is \"4 Reigns\" a novel by   M.R. Kukrit, ex Prime minister, and a son of Prince Kumrop back in 1911. The production is about a life of \"Ploy\" a  daugther of high ranking officials in the reogn of King Rama5 to Kimg Rama 8. Very popular among the Thais especially after the death of The late King Rama 9. Difficult to find parking space . U have to be there early or use MRT subway Cultural Centre Station which is at the entrance of the Esplanade shopping complex where the theatre is located on the 4th floor.",

The theatre was made to resemble a broadway theatre and to attract live broadway plays and other theatrical events.  The seating, acoustic, and viewing is fantastic.  I saw the original broadway cast doing Chicago, and the sound and lighting was perfect.  The problem is that there is barely one play per year.  To get to the theatre take the MRT subway to the Thailand Cultural Center station and take exit 3.  Walk a short distance to the Esplanade Shopping Mall and go to the top floor.  There is a ticket counter, also a Thai Ticket major ticket counter, small restaurant and waiting area, and restrooms, then up the escalator to the theatre.  Hopefully there will be more plays and musicals so that we can appreciate this great facility even more.",

                "text": "My wife read about the '100 Years Old Wooden Bridge' and determined we would see it. I am pleased that she made that decision, though like many things Thai, the signposting left a lot to be desired, but eventually we got there.\nTo be honest, on first sight I somewhat disputed the term 'bridge' thinking it was more of a wooden board walk. Though a bridge it is, as it spans a physical obstacle, the rice paddy, without impacting upon the rice and does provide a safe passage from one side to the other.\nThe bridge is a mere 1 metre high built as it indicates out of timber, though some of its 400 metres of timber planking has been renewed. This does not detract from the whole vista rather the smell of the freshly laid timber enhanced the feeling of being in the country. \nI should mention that some of the boards are out of alignment and some of the newly laid a bit springy, though as all that is required is a sedate walk there should be no problems.\nThe view from the bridge is one of endless rice paddy interspersed on occasions with yellow and orange fragrant flowers, their colours contrasting with the green of the rice. I would recommend visitors wear a hat or carry an umbrella as on our visit the sun beat down mercilessly.\nThere is however little shady spot under a tree complete with a wooden bench for those hot and tired and wanting a rest. Or people like us who just wanted to sit and relax and take in the serenity of the area. \nWe entered the bridge from the highway side where free parking is available. I believe that there is another entry point at the end of the bridge behind the cafe/restuarant. The cafe/restaurant is called 'Tatone Garden Cafe Restaurant'. This establishment serves cold drinks and basic, cheap and delicious Thai food at a reasonable price, There is some shaded and undercover eating areas available and plenty of seating. It was a pleasant place to relax, take advantage of the tranquility of the place and enjoy a quick snack.\nThis is not the 8th Wonder of the World, but I enjoyed the uniqueness of the place, noting that it was originally built as a working construction (not a tourist attraction) to service a need, that of enabling workers in the past and possibly to this day to safely access the rice crops and cross from one piece of land to another, without getting their feet wet.\nWell worth a visit, but remember to take a hat/umbrella.",

This place catered mainly for locals.\nIt's peaceful and great to wander around the stall. It's just 30 min away from central Bangkok. If you want to escape the frenziness of Bangkok and look for a place to relax. This place is for you.\nThere is this lay down and relax vibes with very welcoming stalls sellers.\nEverything is very cheap.\nThere is this small restaurant who only do noodle soup in the middle of the market on the Riverside. It's the best noodle soup I ever eat during our 3 weeks stay in thailand. Its not quite the most sexy settings and it's it bare simple but the broth, it is just excellent. I am a foodie and I travelled to eat food everywhere and for noodle soup I have my fair share of tasting. I promise you this place served the best noodle soup.\n\nI also bought great dessert that is not the mango sticky rice that you found in every corner of Central Bangkok and there were just amazing.\n\n",

Staying at the airport hotel, we were able to jump on a train and take it to the old downtown area just blocks away from the Way Bang Phli Yai Klang.\n\nIn all honesty, we did not do much research on the place we were visiting, so when we entered the monastery we were just dumbfounded in all there was to see!  It was our first time visiting Buddha in a temple, and there were quite a few temples (and Buddhas) to visit.  Home to the \"largest reclining Buddha\", the temple attracts lots of visitors.  In some of the temples there were worshippers kneeling before Buddha, others bringing in offerings of flowers and gifts.  It was just peaceful to sit and be still, and to be welcomed into the temples.\n\nThe Wat Bang Phli is an active monetary, so we caught glimpses of monks in their red and orange robes.  There are beautiful gardens, statues, buildings, doors, etc.  So much gold - it was just amazing.  \n\nWe were able to walk from the Way Bang Phli around the corner to the Kings residence - which is behind quite a large white wall - so not much to see except for the men standing guard.\n\n",

Despite the socks she was wearing being anti slip, they still forced me to buy their branded socks. Never going back again. Already very expensive as it is. And the forced wearing of harbourland branded socks is a policy they should all be ashamed of. \n\nStaff members were extremely rude. They had a go at my daughter for wearing the wrong socks and never came to me (probably because I am farang). It's what annoyed me - that they made her upset and didn't talk to me first. I spoke Thai to some of the staff members but they just looked at me with disdain, didn't give me the time of day. They eventually dug out an English speaking member. I asked the staff member a valid reason why she must wear harbourland branded socks and she kept saying regulation but never gave me a real reason why. I kept saying the sign in English says standardised socks. Doesn't say anything about it needing to be a certain brand. She would not take no for an answer. Would not let it go. Even raised her voice. Never going back here. The place is a money grabbing overpriced boring experience anyway. With rude staff. My daughter was close to tears.",

Anybody who would have common sense will do the same.\n\n\u201cThis is a place could be amazing, but unfortunately there are full of staffs who want to make their own rules. They successfully created a non fun environment. \u201c\n\n\u201cvery slow and inefficient at the cashier. Prepare yourself at least half an hour to buy the ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice place but they are sneaky.  They play the same annoying song over and over until it drives customers crazy and makes you want to leave.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014From other comments.\n\nIf you have a simple request like my kid wants to play this one (buffet)and that one with parents, the staffs play\u201ddon\u2019t understand game\u201d or they really don\u2019t understand ( in this case they have no idea what they doing)\n\nAlso 3 times I came here, I had been told different policy for same games. ( basically they want you to buy more tickets but with very inefficient way, wasting MY time only because they don\u2019t even have customer at that time.)\nI don\u2019t mind paying more money, but as a business, 3 times different rules? Are they made by individual staffs by that minute? Depends on the staff\u2019s mood?\n\nSome staffs were not happy, some of them are sad and miserable, I cant imagine these people would care for kids. One of them almost slammed the door with my kid\u2019s figure there.\n\nBuying tickets are difficult takes long time. They really build up a messy system. Last 2 times I came here I felt like run away from the cashier(downstairs only, upstairs were fine) they are very difficult to communicate while I feel like they are not going to help with anything even they understand( most them speaks zero English).\n\nAnyways, if not because the place has things kids wants to play, I will always avoid it. Then I learnt dont ask, no staff use their brains here.",

The staff are very friendly but English in some shops is problematic, perhaps have a photograph of what you are seeking, or get someone from your hotel to write it down for you. In addition to the big outlets there seems to be a lot of market type stalls to help in the shopping options. Taxi to and from is best. An ice skating rink and cineplex are on offer as well, so plenty for the little ones.",

The Chedi or stupa was originally built by King Rama II on an island partly naturally caused by the accumulation of sand brought down by flood waters, completed by King Rama III and later added its height to 38 meters by King Rama IV who wanted to show all visitors to Thailand that his people were Buddhists. Over the years the river was silted up even more and eventually the island became part of the river\u2019s west bank. It houses 12 sacred relics of Lord Buddha, an image of Buddha \u201cPhra Ham Samut\u201c in the posture of pacifying the ocean and an image of well-known monk \u201cPhra Chai Wat\u201d.

But he died and the pagoda was completed by King Rama III a year later.\n\nEven later King Rama iV wanted to show all foreign visitors to Thailand that the people were Buddhists, so increased the height of the chedi to 38 meters.",

                "text": "We have just returned from a visit to Chulachomklao fort after first reading about it on Richard Barrow's website. Our accommodation is on the Khlong San side of Taksin bridge and we arranged a 'grab hire' where we had the use of car and driver within greater Bangkok for 4 hours at a cost of 1200 Baht. It took 45 mins to get there and 1hr 15 mins to get back so we had two hours at the fort. An hour of this was spent exploring the Mae Khlong ship - access all areas and it was fascinating, then there are the gun placements, Rama V statue, military hardware exhibition and Mangrove walkway compete with monkeys, which we skilfully avoided.\n\nOn top of all this you can see out to the Gulf of Thailand and watch shipping entering the Chao Phraya river. There was a large seafront restaurant which was reasonably busy considering it was a weekday, we only had time to buy drinks and ice creams though.\n\nYou may disagree, but this is my idea of a great day trip from Bangkok and the Grab option just gave us peace of mind that our transport was sorted so we didn't have to worry how we were going to get back to the city. \n\nEntrance to the fort with all its attractions is free.\n\nWe took passports with us as entry is through a checkpoint  but we were not asked for them, perhaps as we arrived with a Thai national who was driving the car. I did spot one other western visitor who was wearing some kind of pass so perhaps if you arrive by tuk tuk or taxi, you may need to provide ID.\n\nOverall, well worth a visit and thanks to Richard Barrow for the recommendation.

There's a small part with a random assortment of old weapons (ranging from Gatling guns to a submarine conning tower), but the signage is all in Thai. The ship - HTMS Maeklong - is definitely the star attraction and I spent a good couple of hours looking around it with my friend. There are no signs or anything, so you have to have at least a little interest and knowledge of naval warfare to get the most out of it, but the fact that you can explore almost every space on the ship makes it really remarkable.\n\nThere are a couple of restaurants and snack stands nearby but a working knowledge of Thai will be very helpful because they clearly don't encounter many western tourists. Make sure you arrange transport there AND BACK. I didn't and getting a taxi to come and collect us was a lot harder than expected.",

Walked about 10 minutes to Pak Nam Market Ferry Pier and got on the boat crossing the river to Phra Samut Chedi.  Then grabbed a motorbike taxi to this place for only 60\u0e3f.  Easy enough huh?  I was dripping wet by the time I got here.  Place was eerily empty - it must have had something to do with these debilitating, intensive heat.  Everything was well maintained though in this oppressive environment.  The fort was clean, and the cannons looked polished.  The ship is a bit a tattered but all in all interesting to explore.  There is a garden/park with all kinds of static displays of naval guns. There is also an interesting boardwalk going through the mangroves inhabited by scores of monkeys.  I think they were too worn down by the heat to bother with me.  It's a seriously interesting place to visit, but I wish I had a guide explaining things or maybe some English signage would be helpful.  There were a couple Navy sailors on the deck of the ship - guess they were guarding it - who did their utmost not to even blink in my direction.  Maybe they were scared I was going to talk to them.  Getting back was fun.  This is how I spent my last day in Thailand.",

My friend and I tried booking Grab car and all of the drivers asked for more, 400 or 500 bhat for a return journey because they say that there will be no passengers coming down. Eventually we booked a car and paid 360 for a return trip and he waited for us. This really spoiled the whole experience for us.",

Luckyly she never been to this place before and she also joine to look around the tample.\n\nThere are a lot of dogs, and i didnt paid entrance ticket because there was nobody.

( I guess around 100 inhabutants ) In the village you will find a small, slightly messy but highly interesting musuem, with a lot of old Thai and Chinese ceramic artifacts. ( Samut chin was originally founded by Chinese traders. ) The musuem has not fixed opening hours, but the mayor living next to it will be happy to open it for you. \nFrom the museum it is another kilometer by foot the Wat Khun Samut. On the way to the temple through the mangrove forest you will see local Fauna as walking fisch, one clawed crabs, birds, monitor lizards and flora typical for this area.\nThe temple Wat Khun Samut is located below sea level, protected by recently erected flood walls. it is located in the middle of a beautiful scenery of sea and mangroves.",

It is an old Navy fort, and it looks like they\u2019re doing a great job restoring it.  Could be a bit difficult to get to you if you\u2019re not driving which I wasn\u2019t.  You have to take the BTS to Pak Nam Station and then walk to the Pak Nam Market Ferry.  Take the 6 baht ferry over to the Samut Chedi side which is something else you should see if you\u2019re coming around here.  Just when the ferry is arriving there, you\u2019ll see a pedestrian suspension bridge which you\u2019re going to have to cross to get to the fort.  After you get off the boat walk straight ahead, exit the market area, and take a right.  Across from the chedi is what looks to be an abandoned building which you\u2019ll have to enter to get on the bridge.  Believe me it\u2019s not that difficult to figure out.  There is a large sitting Buddha statue by the building.  Climb the stairs to the top of the building and there\u2019s the bridge.  Just follow the path after that.  There was a friendly young sailor by the entrance. He just asked my name and what country I came from and I was in.  I guess they\u2019re really just piecing the place together right now.  A few naval artifacts and some cannon is what you\u2019re gonna see.  Looks like a lot of Thai people come here to relax.  There\u2019s some nice views of the river.  I think they got a museum but it was closed when I was there.  I wouldn\u2019t make a special trip here to see this place, but actually you can combine it with with a few other naval attractions in the area if that\u2019s your thing. The chedi close by is real awesome.",

Among the sites were visited was Phra Chedi Klang Nam.\n\nThe age of this chedi is uncertain, but it is thought to be almost 300 years old.\n\nIn itself it is not really impressive.\n\nBut over the years it has played an important role for the local fishing community.   Returning from sometimes dangerous trips to sea, fishermen  would know that they had returned safely home when they could see the spire on the top of the chedi.\n\nThen they would come and pray at the chedi and give thanks for their safe return and for the bounties of the sea.",

It's good to read the reviews under each of the listings.  And, important to be careful in plotting your course to travel here, as it can be very confusing!  Most local people will know the place by the name Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol.\n\nIn any case, a visit is well worth the effort to travel to this relatively remote area and overcome the errors of Google map and others.  It is a truly spectacular place that you won't regret visiting.  Are aren't enough superlatives to do the place justice!\n\nPrepare to climb a lot of steps (nearly 300) if you plan to go to the top of the temple.

                "text": "Some sources call the complex \u201cIsaan Buddhist Park\u201d. No Thai person seems to know that name nor have they ever heard it. I was unable to find out where this title came from. So don\u2019t bother asking Thai people for \u201cIsaan Buddhist Park\u201d, just say the full name or simply \u201cChedi Mongkol\u201d \u2013 and everybody knows what you mean.\n\nPlease don\u2019t ask me for instructions on how to get there. A local friend from Roi-et drove me all the way. The location is approximately 90 kilometres North of Roi-et town. There is no village nearby. The chedi is in the middle of nowhere, so to say. I don\u2019t think you can go there by public transport. You have to go by group tour or hire someone to drive you there. If you decide to drive by yourself, get directions from google maps first.\nSurprisingly enough, there was a large Tesco Lotus in one of the villages on the way, just in case.\n\nShortly before arrival you pass many restaurants. They all sell the same: Grilled chicken and grilled fish, the one with the thick crust of salt \u2013 very delicious!\n\nUpon arrival you can see that the chedi is in the hills of a jungle area. From the parking lot you can either walk five minutes or take the small tractor-train to reach the entrance. The train is free of charge and so was the entrance to the chedi. Avoid Buddhist holidays if you can. There were not many people during my visit, but I\u2019ve been told that it can get very crowded on certain days.  \n\nThe structure is big, I mean really huge. On one sign it is said that the foundation of the building is 101 metres in diameter and the total height is 101 metres as well, referring to the name of the province you are in (Roi-et means \u201cone hundred-one\u201d). The garden surrounding the chedi is well maintained and the photo opportunities are seemingly endless.\n\nWhen you enter the chedi, you\u2019ll find yourself in a gigantic hall that is nearly empty. In the middle of the room are the Buddha images. This area is relatively small in comparison to the rest of the hall. The next two floors look basically the same: Huge empty space with a Buddha worship corner.\n\nI am still puzzled over the fact that there is such a huge, well maintained place in Thailand, rivalling Bangkok\u2019s Grand Palace in size and I never heard of it before.\n\nA visit can be easily combined with visiting Nam Tok Soda, a waterfall not too far away. From there you can actually see Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol protruding out of the dense jungle.\n\nAnother place to add to your trip is the nearby \u201cTham Pha Nam Thip Non-hunting Area\u201d, which does not have the status of a national park, but is treated like one and it is under the authority of the Thai National Park administration. It is just 10 kilometres away.",

Having walked up from the fisherman\u2019s village, there is little non-Thai signage (but Google translate is your friend here!) & once you\u2019ve escaped the monkeys, there are around 100 steps up to the temple itself. Here you\u2019ll be persuaded to part with cash by monks on cell phones who show little interest in you being there or it being a temple & appear to be there only to stop a monkey invasion. The views are amazing & worth the climb, but unless you want to see that or a filthy run down area, don\u2019t bother. Sadly, they don\u2019t seem to bother litter picking so the area is run down & rubbish strewn- though to be fair there are no bins & the monkeys will chase you & take anything they can from you before discarding it, so the issue may not be entirely preventable. i couldn't help but feel that the crumbling infrastructure & apparent total lack of care & pride in the area told the true story of the area which appears to be a money making mine for the monks rather than somewhere they have any pride in or keep nice to celebrate their religion.",

They got this one area that has a group of stupas all bunched-up together. I would've liked to have gotten in there to check them out but it was blocked off. It was really a quick visit. I don't think the people really care about if tourists come or not. Seems like it is a \"working\" temple like a previous review described it. I wish I was a part of that in some way.",

I read a few other reviews that stated this temple is unkept and not maintained very well. I disagree. Yeah, there's a few spots here and there that could use a little paint or fixing up, but the place has a beauty and charm to it that makes such seem trivial. I thought the waterfall with the elephant praying was pretty cool. I was able to do my meditation here as well. I found a beautiful new structure up near the top, played some chanting on my cell, and meditated my usual 15 to 20 minutes. When I finished, I turned around to see four middle-aged women were waiting for me to finish. They all were dressed in white but didn't have shaved heads, so I'm not sure if they were nuns or not. Possibly some kind of supplicant or adherent or something like that. Anyway, they wanted me to take some photos of them which I did. For some reason, I found the whole experience very engaging and alluring. I wanted to see what they were going to do but I didn't and left. I should have. I guess one shouldn't at a temple.",

I believe it's well known for it's somewhat large reclining Buddha that is located sort of off to the back of the main temple. The people at the Tourist Centre in town actually got the name wrong when I went there and showed them some pictures I had taken. Hey, they were nice people who seemed like they were willing to do anything to help me out, and they did. They gave me an awesome English map of Hua Hin that didn't confuse the names of places like Google Maps did online. And I discovered some new temples to see from it. The temple itself - it's quite impressive. I first visited the main temple area with it's variety of structures and statues. Something was going on here and it was quite crowded. I\u2019\uff4d kinda guessing it was a ceremony for a young monk (maybe monks) being ordained or whatever it is properly referred to. Respectfully, I tried to keep my distance even though no one seemed concerned with my presence. After snapping a few pics, I went through what looked like a residential area and found the Reclining Buddha. Here I spent about a half hour or so. Lately I've been try to do a little meditation, Nembutsu chanting, and basically taking a time-out when I visit a temple. I was able to get that in here as nobody was around and felt comfortable doing such. I was also able to light some joss sticks that's been a habit of mine too lately. That day, I lit five instead my usual four for my immediate family. The fifth was for Brandon. This was my first temple visit after writing Brandon's mom a very long, detailed, overpersonal message to her. I hope I didn't overdid it with my words like usual. I hope I didn't hurt her by salting old wounds. Wow, just thinking for a few minutes about Brandon and his mom right now sort of feels as draining as the hours it took me to write that message to her. I'm going back to four sticks at my next temple.",

                "text": "...with a couple of the novice monk kids playing rock/paper/scissors with them. And also there was a young man - monk as well - who spoke English quite well and escorted me around for a little bit. This is a very nice temple complex on a hilltop here in Hua Hin.  Some of their signs advertise a 360\u00b0 view of the area, and there are some pretty nice ones when you get to the top. You know I had a real interesting conversation with that monk about language concerning some Buddhist terms. As well as the Thai I imagine, he knows the English words for some of these terms. What he didn't know was the Sanskrit/Pali that most Buddhists in America use (I believe). So basically, he taught me some English (well I heard those words before but didn't know exactly how they applied to Buddhism) and I taught him (a monk) some Sanskrit/Pali (both of which are sacred Buddhist languages that are similar yet different). I thought our conversation was a beautiful thing. And all you can see here is beautiful too. The large main statue is a standing golden buddha (actually an arhat/disciple) that's so tall it can probably be seen for miles. All kinds of great stuff here: rows of seated monk statues, a buddha here, a buddha there, plenty of things to venerate. Got my meditation in too. Went into the main temple, sat down in front of an awesome altar, and meditated for about 20 minutes while listening to some chanting on my cell phone. An older monk was lying on couch watching some videos on a tablet while I was there; I hope I didn't disturb him. So afterwards I walked around a little more, went down the hill where those kids were, played a little more rock/paper/scissors with them, and went inside another temple which seemed to be a working temple where the monks do what they do during the day. Nobody seemed to be bothered by my presence - in all a very nice visit despite the hour walk in the blazing Thai sun it took me to get there.",

Picked me up from my hotel in a nice big clean and proper car. I felt safe wherever he drove- even way up in the mountains. He was the kinda guide i wanted, the one who gave my inner Earth child the space to connect with the natural beauties of the environment we explored (he took me through hidden - probably also forgotten paths, to places with spectacular views, places where most tourists wouldn't dare to go...we had to climb through some bushes though, but it was all worth it!)\n\nHe was willing to take photos whenever i requested and was even a good ear for me to tell my life story! Pricing also not bad at all, when taking into account all the sites i saw! My highest recommendation would be the \"Three whales\" and \"Wat Phu Tok\".\n\nThanks guy for making that trip so memorable!!",

Outside of the parks in Bangkok such as Lumpini Park, I haven't seen a Thai park as good as this. Any major city in the world would be impressed to have a park like this. We were here in the day and it was so pleasant to stroll around, People told me that it's beautiful at night but the sign  said that it closes at 20.00. But it does open at 4.00 for the early fitness crew and walkers. The children's playground is exceptionally good and there are some beautiful trees such as banyans (the Buddha tree} and  fig trees. The Giant Buddha is impressive but the surrounds are rather plain and sterile. There is a biking circuit but in the middle of the day must have been too hot for the cyclists. The park was very clean but the lake was suffering from rainy season and was pretty green",

                "text": "This wonderful nature's creation is in the area of Phu Sing National Park. First of all, ones have to hire 4WD pickup truck (together with a driver guide) which cost 500 baht  and can hold passengers upto maximum of 10 (It should be noted that vehicles other than 4WD pickup truck are not allowed in this activity). Although it is legal to drive your own 4WD pickup truck, you are still recommended to hire a car and a driver because the path is cut through the dense forest and is very narrow so that 2 cars cannot use this path simultaneously, therefore all chauffeurs have to use walkie-talkie to communicate with others.\n\nAs our car climbed up the mountain (07:45 am), we (in the back of pickup truck) felt the cool fresh air with gentle breeze. After 20 minutes of penetrating through the rainforest, we reached our first stop on a huge rock at the edge of the cliff which provides panorama view of the forest below. Then, we walked to the highlight \"3 whale rocks\", 3 purple huge rocks protrude from the cliff resemble 3 whales (view from above and imagine) of different sizes ( 2 bigger rocks called \"father\" and \"mother\", while the inaccessible smaller one called \"baby\"). This point also provides a panorama view of greenish forest below. \n\nThe next stop is \"elephant rock\". Without using any imagination , it is undoubtedly an elephant! The driver then took us to \"Phu Sing gate\", 2 standing huge rocks at the edge of the cliff forming \"little gorge\" that looks like a big gate to the thick jungle (and fabulous view) below. After that, we drove to \"Phu Sing wall\", a natural vertical rock wall with beautiful pattern. Finally, our last checkpoint was a quirky place called \"Sang Roi Bor\", bumpy landscape contain hundred of holes at the edge of the cliff. Of course, you can see a panorama view of abundant forest at this point.\n \nBesides the stunning views, our chauffeur was very nice and provided us some interesting historical facts about this place. Around late 70's to early 80's, the forest was used to be communists' hideout (as underground organization). Some comrades passed away here and their bodies were buried somewhere in the forest. This is why the alternate name of the forest is \"pink jungle\" (bit lighter than \"red\").\n\nThis amazing place is \"the must\" for ones travelling to Bueng Kan. Don't miss this ! Highly recommended.\n\nVisited 7 September 2020",

Water and food are available at the entrance of the park. After you enter you won't find anymore supplies. You can walk on the top of two of the rocks.

The other is off of highway 4, which leads you to a wooden boardwalk. My review is of the boat trip off of highway 4020.\n\nI showed up here around 10AM, hardly anyone around but when I asked if I could hire a boat, someone made a phone call and within a few minutes a boatman arrived. Be aware that not much English is spoken here, but basic communication is still possible. The boat fee is the same no matter how many are in your group - 500 thb. Trip lasted about an hour. Lots of bird life, although it's off in the distance - if you want good bird photos be sure to bring more than just a phone to take photos with. Lotus flowers were sparse, but I knew this before I arrived. The boatman said the flowers come in around December.\n\nBe aware, as others have noted, that if you come from Hua Hin, your navigation app will have you turn off highway 4020 onto an unnamed road which turns to dirt in 50 meters. This is not the correct road. Stay on the highway another few kilometers until you reach Samroiyod 6. From here navigation is correct. When you reach the sign for the ranger station at the end of the paved roadway, turn left and drive to the water's edge. ",

I'm pleased to say that we had a great half day there. The new boardwalk is fabulous and we walked the full 600-800 metres and back (we had to walk back as it doesn't reach the land at the other end). There's a great lookout tower, and during our hour on the boardwalk Lan was able to identify many bird species. After a simple lunch at the on-site restaurant, we then took the one-hour boat trip through the marsh. Again this was very interesting, highlighting the many features of this unique environment, in particular the magnificent hills that rise steeply up from the water. As always with Thai National Parks there's a shortage of information in English and I had lots of unanswered questions, but if you enjoy nature then you can't help but be impressed by this place.",

                "text": "This is a huge modern temple which my partner took me to see when were were staying in Sukhothai (about an hour's drive away).  There are many buildings with different designs, and I would love to know more about its designer, purpose and funding, etc., but so far not been able to discover anything informative in English.  It is quite unlike any other wat I've visited throughout Thailand.\n\nIt's mighty impressive in scale,and some of it is truly beautiful (I'm commenting as a non-religious person, and obviously there is deeper meaning to it all if you are Buddhist).  It is well worth visiting when exploring this part of Thailand.\n\nMy only gripe really is that having put so much thought and effort into design, and having spent what must have been a huge amount of money on the buildings, the grandeur and beauty of it all is rather spoiled by the ubiquitous wires hanging everywhere (why not put them below ground), cars parked within the precinct, and large \"advertising\" signs (for want of a better word): all of this detracts from the beauty and the potential tranquility.",

There was the main temple and it was very lovely. There was a main building behind this, but it was being restored when I was there so you were not allow into the building. There is the river boat entry down the back so there was a lot of people going to this via this temple. There was at least 5 dogs there that were OK with you walking around until a local in a car turned up and they all went nuts. He was clearly someone that they all liked and the barking showed this while he was there. Seen a few Monks in the large building next to the temple and they have a great building that I believe you could visit and pray but I didn't do so as this was not the reason that I was going to see what was there.",

                "text": "Popular among locals, I have to say that this temple has everything. After we had entered through a Lanna style teak door, we first went to the main hall to worship the principle Buddha image and see some murals. Then, we wandered around the place taking some photos, watching a cultural dance performed by local children, shopping at the a little community market. Next, we visited a Thai-Lanna teak house which operates as a museum. Inside the museum, there are a wax model of the first abbot, old photos, ancient artifacts, silverware, rare stones. Subsequently, we chilled out and had some drinks a coffee shop on the terrace behind the main hall. There are many nice spots to take photos such as a traditional Lanna hut in the front of the temple, twin palm trees, or a viewpoint behind the main hall where you can see a beautiful view of greenish rice field and bamboo weave bridge with mountainous background. We also took a stroll on this bamboo bridge over the rice field to another cafe and a little market that sells clothes. Highly Recommend!",

Lots of photo opportunities and grownups and children will love the place . I recommend 1 - 2 hours. You can also buy reasonably priced refreshments.",

This is also a car park and place for street stalls. Try a cup of coffee made in a sock. This is a French legacy from over the river - dark roasted and served with condensed milk. Next door is the covered IndoChina Market. The French name Indochine is transcribed into Thai and the market is called 'Dtalat Indochina.' It is similar to many such markets in Thailand, Cambodia and Lao but it is not aimed at tourists, so you will find local produce. It closes at 6 pm.  The rest of the town is in bed by 10 pm.  There is a sort of promenade on the other side of the road beside the river. It faces due east, so sundowners are backlit. A few foreigners may take beer bottles to the prom and watch the last of the light across the great river Mekong. The night is dark on the other side. Early to bed and rise in these parts of the world.",

He saw my family love to took photo then he opened the door in front of Buddha image then I got nice pic in this review  \n\nWeak point\nThere are just 2 monks in this temple so it hard to manage a big old temple.

I can say there is a lot of influence of Laos and Burma as they resemble a lot from the temples you can see over there. There is also a museum in the temple where by you can see lots of artifices.",

The boardwalk includes a well-build hanging bridge and they have a tall (78 steps) birdwatching tower that affords great views out across the bay.  They also have kayaks for rent, but they waves were too high for us to bother the day we visited.  The entire area was spotless and well maintained.",

Rather it was first-come, first serve. There was some competition in getting kayaks but we were lucky and did not have to wait. That said, we got three kayaks for five people, at a total cost of Baht 200 which is a ridiculously cheap price for what they provide. There is no guide, which is great because we didn't want one or need one, and the kayaking \"trail\" takes about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to complete. Initially it skirts the mangrove/bay area, but the second half of the trail follows inlets into the mangrove area. It was a really great trip. We were there on a Sunday when it should have been really packed but still had no trouble getting access to kayaks. In order to get to the kayaks you have to walk to the very end of the boardwalk which is about half a kilometer, but we didn't mind. I mention it just FYI.",

It\u2019s such a dreadful shame that the pollutants & litter left by people who don\u2019t care & can\u2019t be bothered to put in a bin, spoil this area.\nWill not be back! Kata Noi beach & water is beautiful & crystal clear.",

I liked the fact its so close to Pattaya and Bangkok roughly an hour each way and I also like thats not tarnished with girly bars if you live there the cost of living is less than Bangkok and Pattaya. The water and beach are nice but plastic rubbish in the water and on the 5KL. Long beach is a bit of turn off, plastic in the water and one the sand, this is very much a Thai resort location best hotel is Tide with Heritage coming in close second great Thai food at THB 35 for cheapest noodles. House and condo option are not great near the beach Onpa is quite good at roughly THB 9500/ per month for years contract and utilities at THB 1500 per month. Good coffee shops and hidden places to discover. Being a University town there its very young crowd for best part. For Western food you have Momo Click Cafe BMC Burger  but a motor scooter is needed and can rented for about THB500 a day. Nice market next to Le Cafing where you can get Gin and Tonic for THB 80 or THB 120 for double and lot of nice cheap food shirts and candy. Great coffee shops Le Cafing Tripple N and Click Cafe traffic is heavy on weekends, Tuesday there are no vendors on the beach is nice quite day but bring your fold up chair. So for westerners is not a great bar scene but you make do Buff House Escobar Laguna Junk Pub Izakate sort of work one shopping mall with Tops Supermarket or Makro for your cheese etc can be done.",

As evening continued, the street food stalls became busier, but rather than feeling overwhelmed, we felt a buzz of excitement. \nThere are so many stalls that range from  food to  clothing/accessories. \nMoney exchange stalls are at the entrance to the market and there is a taxi rank out the front, which brings an ease of travel. \nWe recommend visiting on a Monday/Wednesday/ Friday or Saturday or Sunday.

There are a number of ruins nearby, but this appeared to be the best maintained. Wat Chedi Luang was once, Chiang Saen\u2019s main temple. There is a large chedi and the ruins of a wiharn nearby. There appears to be some renovation going on here, with a new roof visible and a new Buddha image installed, although the sides of the hall are still open. There are a number of tall trees here giving shade to the area. \nChiang Saen National Museum, Wat Phra Buat, Wat Mung Muang and  Wat Maha That, are all within walking distance of Wat Chedi Luang. We visited all this ruins but the museum was closed for renovation. It took us about 1 hour to walk around and capture some pictures of this area.",

After reaching another port, you have to hire local motor tricycle driving about 1 km along the narrow cement path surrounded by the sea water. Finally, by walking along the bridge will lead you to the isle where the temple located. To avoid sea water, the ground of the temple was lifted up such that visitor has to crawl into the hall. Also, there are Chinese shrine and a standing Buddha statue facing the sea at the tip of the isle. Furthermore, there is a walking path to explore an abundant mangrove forrest and local community (this path also lead you to to the museum and homestay). Tranquil atmosphere, I like this.",

The trees are hanging heavy with the furry flying mammals, and caution is advised if you want to avoid unpleasant precipitation from above! The bats are quite a spectacle, however, and well worth seeking out.  The temple is situated alongside the Bang Pakong River, which makes for a peaceful and attractive setting. Tip: if you want a close-up view of the bats, you can climb a few meters up a small tower just inside the temple gate, taking you up to tree top level and eye-to-eye with some of the roosting bats.  There is no charge to enter and wander about the temple grounds.",

You are also allowed to bring your own food and drink on to the boat. \n\nEarlier reviews indicate the experience may have have been better with Momo as the guide.

So we had a nice medley of sick and cigarettes\n\nAlso the snorkels weren\u2019t sanitised in a bucket of anything, just taken out of a bin bag so hopefully they were sanitised before we saw them. \n\nLunch on the beach was the most bland Khao pad gai I\u2019ve ever had. If there\u2019s not going to be a lunch buffet or anything then the food could do with being a little bit better than frozen veg with egg fried rice. \n\nAnd as bad as plastic/rubber wristbands are for the environment I\u2019d imagine they\u2019re better than a torn bit of clothing that\u2019s thrown away after every trip. Saw a few floating around in the sea after snorkelling. \n\nBut yeah nice trip, enjoyed everything we saw but tour guide definitely matters.",

Momo is so flamboyant and energetic and made us all feel safe and relaxed. He had a super fun play list of music while we travelled and had some very interesting and sometimes sad stories that made you appreciate the island for more that just a tourist attraction. I was alone for the tour but ended up having dinner with a few of the people I met and with Momo. It made it such a great day. I can't rate this tour higher than 5 stars otherwise I would.",

I was very glad I wore my running shoes instead of slippers! It gets quite steep (still very safe) in some areas. When going downhill, make sure your shoes have grip as the slope can get slippery if wet. There are handrails there if you need. \n\nThere is a 50bht entry fee at Viewpoint 1's entrance. The funds go towards maintaining the viewpoint/s. It was also worth it with the thought and presentation that went into the decoration at VP1 specifically. VP2 was also nice and clean. \n\nThe reason for the 4-stars (based on my experience) is because I found it to be overcrowded at VP2 at the time that I went which was around sunset. While I understand that sunset is THE ideal time to go, it would have been nice if the others weren't so loud and smoked so much weed that it made the whole place smell so pungent. Though, I do understand that I may have just been unlucky at the time. \n\nNevertheless, the viewpoint itself is definitely a 5-star. There is a cafe at VP2 for you to order drinks from. The views are amazing, you can see the 2 sides of the island and generally the beautiful Koh Phi Phi landscape. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.",

When we checked into our room it was insanely hot to the point that we felt faint and could not breathe. When compared to other hostel rooms ours was the only room like this so we mentioned the problem to reception and were just rudely told to stay out of the room between 11am and 5pm until air con. Toilets and showers are so unclean and unsanitary you basically needed to stand over a communal toilet seat to use the shower head. I chose to shower outside at the pool due to this. No door to separate the girls bathroom from the hallway so very exposed when getting ready. Bunk beds are old and noisy so any movement in the metal would keep us awake unless we had ear buds. Would not recommend, staff unhelpful. It was a shame for such a beautiful island and decent pool party",

We caught the 9.30am speedboat over to Koh Phi Phi and were met by our two boat captains.  We visited all the sights and had a simple but tasty lunch onboard and fresh cut melon and pineapple.  We had time to snorkel and swim and had 90 mins free time at the end to discover the local town.  We caught the 4.30pm speedboat back and were taken back to Patong Bay which is about a 50 mins drive from Rassanda pier.  All in all a very good day.  Special mention to Celina the administrator for the company, she was responsive and kept us informed.  two days before our arrival by cruise ship, she sent us details and photographs of our drivers/mini bus and had them wait with a sign with our parties name on it.  It was reassuring to know that someone cable was looking after the details.",

                "text": "Now I've done this before years ago so this experience was more for my children. Picked up at 8.30, arrived around 9.30  and we waited and waited and waited. We could help ourselves to tea and coffee. Where were the snacks and light breakfast as mentioned in the leaflet? It was after 11 before we set off. \nThe guide was Russian, couldn't speak English much so the whole pre boarding speech which went on for more than 10 minutes was only in Russian. I did question him! There were 3 French and 4 of us the rest Russian. Us 7 did not get any information whatsoever. We were left to figure it out. Very unsafe and not very professional. \n\nThey sell it as a nice speed boat max 30 on board, but let me tell you there were over 40 people on board totally cramped. We had loud, rude and thoughtless Russians on board who didn't care about the rest of us. Drinking alcohol all the whole way. Now the sea was very rough and we had to wear our life jackets at all times. The boat overpacked and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. People were sick everywhere. My youngest was frightened and is now traumatised from that trip. \nWe couldn't go snorkeling properly, we didn't stop at places because we couldn't and obviously Maya bay was closed, this wasn't said when booking. Basically the whole itinerary was changed. Lunch was at phi phi don, absolutely awful, the worst food we had in all the trips we did!\n\nSo the everythig about this trip, the food, the company was absolutely awful. We came away from this trip with absolute disgust. I will never do this type of trip again.\nI have done more personal private boat tours of 6 to 10 people in the past and in future will stick to a more smaller and better experience rather than be moved around like cattle! \n\nLast note, I can see how much Thailand has changed, its all about numbers on the boats and how much money is made. There were several tour operators doing the same thing. Everyone is trying to sell you something on the islands and you are rushed everywhere from Island to Island. Such a shame. This was not a nice or enjoyable experience. Please do your research before booking one of these trips  and I would suggest you avoid (Speed Boat Suleman) \n",

We had to wait quite a bit and between the waiting and the transportation, we maybe had 3 hours on the water, if that. The guide did not speak any English. We maybe saw two areas that were listed on the itinerary provided. One of the main reasons we chose to book with Rob was because he told me he would go on the excursion with us for photography purposes and that he would supply under water cameras and drones, as long as we threw in a pretty decent tip for the driver. He lied to us about running late and just never showed. No photography,, no underwater cameras, no drone footage. There are plenty of other operators who would charge way less than $90 per person for way more time and also with English speaking operators, or at least someone who followed the itinerary provided. The operator tried to charge us more on the boat to go to Maya Bay.  Very disappointed! Book elsewhere! ",

                "text": "Pirate tour\n\nMy husband booked this tour before we left and paid a deposit. He was told he would be sent details of where to meet our boat captain the afternoon before the tour & we would need to be at the place where long boats are moored on tonsai bay at 8am. \nWhen we asked which boat he said no, other side near slinky bar. So we had to walk to the other beach. This is not a big problem, but we were hot & worried after reading other reviews. \nEventually (around 8:15) he sent a message  with the boat name. It was a long tail that had just arrived. \nThe captain put the ladder for the boat out for us & helped us into the boat. He spoke very little but drove us to a site with lots of other boats & said it was for snorkelling & gave us snorkel each. The boat had to stop quite at away from where we were to snorkel. We swam to the shore & it was probably a bit too far for us without life jackets, although we are all very good swimmers.  \nThe next spot we went to was beautiful & the captain said \u201cfor swim\u201d instead of snorkelling. He was spot on, it was no good for snorkelling but we swam a bit. We asked for more snorkelling & he took us just a little further away & had a great opportunity to snorkel. Then we went a loooong way from there (we were unsure where as it seems like back to tonsai bay!) & this was definitely our favourite spot\u2026Nui Bay. There were amazing things to see & a beach of you wanted to swim to it. If we had more time in phi phi we might have gone back via kayak. We snorkelled a bit, had lunch then snorkelled some more. GORGEOUS creatures to see. \nWhile here we asked what time we\u2019re finished & he said about 20min so we made the list to the snorkelling & then he drove us back to the bay.  \nThe captain was always very polite but understood pretty much zero English. This was only really a problem at the end when my husband was trying to follow Robert\u2019s instructions to \u201cpay in Thai baht on the day\u201d. He thought that meant pay the captain, so he did. 3000 baht. The captain was very unclear (later Robert explained he was new to his team of captains) but we were sent a receipt by Robert almost immediately. Curiously, later we found the amount was debited from our bank account also. My husband put a hold on the payment & emailed Robert who apologised & tried to explain it but it still didn\u2019t make sense. We\u2019re still not sure what happened but I think he didn\u2019t mean for us to pay the captain cash. We have read all the reviews & we genuinely don\u2019t think Robert is trying to scam anyone, but the communication is not clear. Perhaps it is an issue if lost in translation, also that Robert is the tour organiser but contracts out to captains to run the tours. This the need to send a recent photo & not knowing who he\u2019d assign & where they\u2019d be.\nThere were life jackets on the boat but we didn\u2019t need to use them really. If you are at a spot where you have to swim a distance from the boat you should take them anyway to feel more security as the best snorkelling is not always right where the boat is. \nOur captain brought fried rice & stuffed omelette for our lunch, one dish each person. They were delicious. He had cut up pineapple & watermelon for us for \u2018morning tea\u2019. He also had a small bottle of cold water for each of us.\nThis was a private tour, only for us & we enjoyed that aspect. Our kids also benefitted from not needing to go places other people might want. \n\nTips/FYI\n-Ask for very specific & clear details of how much, when & how payment will be made.\n-Take your own snorkel. Two of the ones available were very ordinary\n-Some of the islands you could be taken to require you to pay for entry. When our captain offered & said that we would have to pay we just said no thank you. If you have particular ideas of where you want to snorkel you can make requests.",

He was so genuine in his excitement for the day and all the amazing fish and wildlife we saw! 100% would recommend for anyone wanting an amazing day out! Lunch was lovely and was so easy not having to pay the tax at Maya Bay (included in the cost for the tour). Mr Mote also makes sure you get to the popular spots before the crowds and takes amazing go pro footage! Thanks again legend!",

The employees here treated you with respect and understanding, even faced with flight delays. The airport pickup is on time with the luxury van and polite, but smart tourguide. The highlight is on the second day where we went on a speed boat to do some snorkeling at a beautiful reef near Koh Rok. Most of the year this section of Koh Lanta National Parks is closed off from tourists, but from October it is open. The reef ecosystem is still intact, and you can see some beautiful parot fish. The lunch on the island is delicious with mussaman curry and fried chicken. The staff for the cruise trip can speak Mandarin, English and Thai. Highly recommended!",

                "text": "Con: I have never been so discriminated against I my whole life. I paid 1600 baht for all you can drink open bar for my self and my blind partner. I went to the bar and explain in text and in a speaking that my partner is blind and that he was at a table a and they bartenders still refused to serve me. I was at the bar for more than 20 minutes and they refused to serve me. I had to walk out to the manager at the front and tell them that my partner is blind and that he could not make it to the bar. And the managers told me it was policy that guest bring empty cups to get served and I told them that the employees never served me a single drink. They discriminated against me and my blind husband. Little did the know I am a native Thai speaker and I know what they said. Khun apple at the open bar on March 16, 2023 was especially rude. She smiled to my face and told her colleges not to serve me when I approached another bartender. Such terrible lack of service. I\u2019ve been to Costa Rica, Japan, Korea, Jamaica, Bahamas, etc. and have never been DENIED service as a paying customer. I showed the bartender my receipt at the bar with my name on it because I paid for my partner and I and they still refused to serve me. We\u2019re from the United states and love R&B music and I looked up this placed based on its good reviews. But I never thought I would experience such discrimination especially on my honeymoon trying to show my husband how amazing my country was. I stay for 2 hours smoking hookah and drinking and no one came to just and apologized. The only thing the assistant manager did was walk me to the bar and order me the first two drinks( but only after she went to my table and confirmed that my husband was blind and used a seeing cane). The appalling attitude of the bartenders at the open bar needs to be corrected. I\u2019ve attached pictures of my wrist band and a picture of my husband during our court house wedding with his cane so all can know that the #1 club in Patong is discriminating against disabled individuals. Pros: music, MC, the cleaned club.",

I wish I had read the reviews before I decided to visit the place and waste my time.  \nMy first time in Thailand and this is the impression I'm going to be taking back about the country. \nYou guys really need to step out of your bubble and see where the world is really heading.

I can assure you that the fundamental team is the same as it was then including the entertainment and marketing director, myself as well as our great DJs. We have received many positive reviews in the last 1.5 years and as I have monitored them for 6 years, they are even better then they were prior. In addition, our drink pour standard is the same and our prices have scaled to match other clubs of our standard. \n\nI am happy to speak to you further on these issues if you like and would only ask that you email our reservation@theclubatkoi.com asking for the social media manager to initiate the process. \n\nKind regards and we hope we have opportunity to serve you again soon.\"",

The 'zoo' element is weak to say the least, unless you consider chickens and rabbits as an attraction. There was just the one visible croc, no idea if there were others hiding.\n\nThe main statues were in an area currently undergoing some serious work so access was a bit wobbly and photographs had to be raised up a touch, but that aside they are beautiful monuments. \n\nAnd then there's the Kung Fu Panda statues, and the Happy Feet ones and the massive gongs to have a whack at...\n\nIt really is a very odd place, but in many ways, this makes it worth the visit.\n\nOne note of caution, getting back from here is a bit of a challenge.

We spent two days volunteering and were entrusted with walking dogs, on-leash, off-leash, in clean, grassy enclosures, or a purpose built pool area. They run an incredible operation including what has been a highly successful CNVR - catch, neuter, vaccinate, return - program not just in Phuket but other parts of Thailand too. They have an onsite hospital to care for dogs, there are many sections housing dogs (and cats) according to age, (special) needs, etc. and they do their utmost to nurture dogs so that they may return to their community, or be adopted, or be assimilated on-site. I saw videos of adopting families who spoke of how clean, clearly loved, the animals were when they received their new pet at the other end of their plane journey. It was inspiring and heart-warming to see the kindness and humane-ness these animals are experiencing after clearly going through hard lives, as seen in their lack of one or both eyes, one leg, or bearing scars. Volunteering at Soi Dog is a meaningful form of tourism, and also a wonderful opportunity to meet and connect with other traveller-volunteers from far-flung parts of the world. I highly recommend it. It will enrich your holiday in Phuket. And you will, like us, want to return to Phuket and Soi Dog. Big shout out to the amazing staff and full-time volunteers at Soi Dog!",

This enriches their lives while they heal from the traumas that resulted in them living here, and increases their chances of being adopted.\n\nThank you for encouraging others to volunteer. With over 1,400 dogs and over 400 cats here now, we are in need of more volunteers than ever!\n\nWe hope to welcome you back again one day!\n\nBest wishes. \n\n",

We walked along the fields, feeding the elephant, before showering her off. She appeared well cared for at all times and we were glad to hear that at night time they are given free run of the fields, and only wear the ankle chain in the day. \nThe volunteers are clearly passionate about the caring for the elephants. Our contribution helps feed, house and look after them humanely.",

Our volunteer was very knowledgeable. She told us about the sanctuary and how the elephants came to be there along with some information about each elephant. There were 4 elephants when we went. \nThe walk with the elephant was a neat experience. We also each got a basket of bananas to feed the elephant along the way. At the end, we each got to hose off the elephant with water. I was surprised that we were the only 2 people during our walk and bath. There were other couples at the sanctuary, but they kept each group separate. \nI didn\u2019t expect the elephants to be chained in their pens and to receive no safety tips before heading out with the elephant. When asked, the volunteer told us how to walk with the elephant safely and why they were chained up. I felt like the elephants were loved and well cared for. The elephant caretakers sell bracelets and other jewelry. I bought a cute bracelet as the money goes to the family of the caretakers. Overall, we made fun memories!",

It is great that you chose to visit on a day when you knew our English speaking Volunteers would be available. As you experienced, our Volunteers are very knowledgeable and love to share their knowledge with our visitors. We are sorry that you were not given any safety tips before setting off on your walk with one of our elephants and were only told how to walk with the elephant when you asked. This is certainly not acceptable and will be taken up with the Volunteers. Safety of our elephants, visitors and staff is our number one priority and a safety briefing about walking and being around our elephants should be given each and every time. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. With regards to the chains (as your Volunteer told you, when you asked) you would have noticed during your visit the Foundation has no walls, fences or gates and is completely open next to a busy main road. Elephants are also very big and potentially dangerous animals and the use of chains is necessary and an important part of managing elephants in a traditional hands-on system in South East Asia where there are no enclosures to contain the elephants. It is lovely to hear you thought our elephants are loved and well cared for and you made fun memories!\n\nKozy, Head Volunteer, Hutsadin",

There is still the constant building work going on, with some areas of the site blocked off. \n\nThe whole place is really just a rich man's folly opened up to the public. For the cost of admission, 700 Baht, you are supplied with a clanking old bike, or use of the sightseeing bus service. I used the bike, as I need the exercise, and prefer the freedom of it. \n\nI spent about 5 hours clanking my way around the place, on what seemed to be a very quiet midweek day. Discovered that they really, really, REALLY, don't want you to photograph the elephants. I suspect that this is because they want people to pay for the privilege. \n\nFor me, the highlight of the place was the Mauy Thia show. It's held at multiple times of the day. I was surprised by how low the attendance for it was. Maybe it was because of the day I went there.\n\nIf you are in Bangkok, this place is somewhere that you should visit. If nothing else, you will get lots of photos to wow your friends with when you get home.",

Bike hire was cheap but the bikes are in terrible condition, one of the seats were broken and tires flat. It\u2019s probably best to hire a golf buggy instead. The worst part is the mistreatment of the 5 elephants they have onsite which we saw at the end of our tour. All had their front feet chained together in a small enclosure. Heart breaking.

The path/steps in the interior of the cave can be very slick in spots, so watch out.  Generally, the cave is lit, but to be safe, I'd carry a flashlight (phone light would work okay if the power goes out). The views from the two cave entrances on opposite sides of the mountain are worth the hike. Baht 20 is the suggested donation for the utilities.  Remember to have proper attire (long pants and sleeved shirt) if you are going to enter the Wat's temples. Not a bad drive from our home in Mueang Loei, about an hour.",

Simple temple at the base, not overly ornate, good small market and food sellers. Access to the cave is via 600 steps....the are a few rest points along the climb...it easier coming down though, 555.\nInside of cave sits a large buddha overlooking the land and many old artefacts.\nActual visit was 2009 and March 2016",

The Cave is set half way up a mountain so there are more than 600 steps to climb to reach it and if you want to see the view point at the other end of the cave be prepared to climb another couple of hundred steps. Having said that the views are worth the effort. The huge cave itself is impressive to say the least but last time we were there some of the lights weren't working so some care must be taken when negotiating the way through as the limestone can be slippery in places. This may have been rectified but I just wanted to give you the heads up just in case. All in all a very interesting experience and aplace I take all my visitors from overseeas to see. Enjoy! :-)",

Basically, a baseball team size group of kids followed me all through the cave complex chatting in Thai (I speak a fair bit of Thai) and pointing out bee hives and all kinds of stuff that I never would have noticed on my own. \n\nEven without the awesome group of monks, I would have fully enjoyed the cave. It's nowhere near as big as say the one down in Nakhon Si Thammarat...it's more like a larger and more authentic version of the one at Halong Bay, if you've ever seen that one. Anyway, I liked it. And it never hurts to do a few steps on vacation to burn off the beers!",

Do carry proper footwear, as the steps are dodgy in some areas, and inside the cave it can get slippery.  Marvelous view as you get to  the top, as well as at the other side of the cave. Pity that the grounds (& the inside of the cave) are not kept clean - plastic bags, bottles, etc around.  So far no admission fee !!  Probably best to visit in the morning.

Decent shoes help here, the floor is very slippery in places and the ground is quite uneven. Once you're in the main cave you are struck by the enormity of the place, its huge!

There are a few shady places to sit and relax, but most of the foot path is in the sun, making morning and early evening the best times to visit. The children's play area on the north side is larger and better maintained than the one on the south. There are a few shops and food stalls along the road on the east and west sides. Chinese Cultural Center (south side) provides the best photo opportunities, and as far as I could tell the only public toilets. Walking time around the lake is between 30 and 40 minutes. Worth a trip if you are near by, but not a destination on its own. ",

                "text": "Over a period of 30 years this was my 3rd visit of Khao Phanom Rung historical park. \n\nWe arrived by car and took a combo ticket for Khao Phanom Rung and Prasat Hin Mueng Tum, 150 Baht per foreigner and 50 Baht parking fee. We took Gate 3 which allowed us to drive up to the top of the mountain, there from the parking place is easy access to the temple. There is another parking lot at gate 1 from where one climbs up the mountain to the level of the temple from the east. I recommend the upper parking lot for those who are not used to climb up narrow steps. \n\nPhanom Rung is a Hindu-Khmer temple comprising ruins of construction that was completed from the 10th to the 13th centuries. The temple has several beautiful lintels, the most famous being the Phra Narai Lintel, above the east portal, which was returned to Thailand from a museum in the United States in 1988, after the temple had been restored by the Thai Department of Fine Arts.\n\nThe view from up top is splendid. We started from the top level and climbed down to the start of the steps, with a brief visit to the Phanom Rung museum, not much to see there. The climbing up is a wonderful experience as finally the top of the main building slowly comes into sight. \n\nThere were quite a number of local and foreign tourists but the area is so large that no crowd  developed anywhere. \n\nDisturbing were the pigeons, the Fine Arts department should get rid of them as they soil the dark spots and in the long run definitely will ruin part of the structures.",

Nonetheless, it is still very impressive and well worth visiting, and well worth the 100 baht fee for foreigners (20 baht for Thais).  There are two options for accessing the temple: Gate 1, from which you climb up the mountain to the level of the temple from the east; and Gate 3, which allows you to drive up to the top of the mountain.  The east access is more impressive, but definitely a lot more work to climb.  The small mountain itself is a long-dormant volcano (yes; there are volcanoes in Thailand!).  The Hindu-Khmer temple itself comprises ruins of construction that was completed from the 10th to the 13th centuries.  The temple has several beautiful lintels, the most famous being the Phra Narai Lintel, above the east portal, which was returned to Thailand from a museum in the United States in 1988, after the temple had been restored by the Thai Department of Fine Arts.",

The area is filled with horrible sculptures, showing scenes of torture and killing, depicting what can happen to you if you do not lead a virtuous life. It is definitely not a place where you should go with children.\n\nMost of the horror scenes are located near the entrance of the temple. Further back you see more innocent sculptures like dinosaurs and the 12 animals depicting the Chinese zodiac. These offer you a good photo opportunity to take a picture of yourself with \u201cyour\u201d Chinese year. Also in the back is an elevated temple covered by gold leaf.\n\nMany of the sculptures are quite old and worn. However, this just adds to the special charm of the place. Some of them have a coin slot at the front, so if you throw a coin in, the figures will move and give sounds \u2013 if it works. The one we tried didn\u2019t.\n\nAll in all a place which we recommend to visit if you are into such weird attractions.",

Even the view across the countryside, on a clear day, is particularly good.\nThe colours and the intricacy of the figures and decoration are absolutely amazing and certainly illustrate the skill of the designers and craftsmen and women. \nWhat ever you do, don\u2019t rush! Make sure camera batteries are fully charged because it\u2019s difficult to know when to stop taking photos!\nThere\u2019s ample car parking immediately in front of the temple and toilets not too far from the entrance. Admission is free although there are plenty of donation boxes.\nOne of the great attractions in Chiang Mai and highly recommended.",

We reached here as part of a taxi tour of the temples in Chiang Sean and the golden triangle a few kilometres away. In Chiang Saen, it is located just outside the city's old walls, and is about 850 meters from Wat Phrathat chedi Luang. Admission ticket is 50Baht\nThere are a few ruins here amidst the trees, but the most beautiful and best preserved is a Chedi like structure with intricate carvings right to the top of the chedi. The Park is well maintained, clean quiet and peaceful away from noise. There are sign boards explaining the site and structures here. We were there at 3pm but it was quite hot and best to carry a hat, sunblock and water with you. We spent about 30 minits here to look around and capture some pictures. We did not see any taxis waiting around, as there were hardly any visitors to this place, therefore it would be advisable to organise transport both ways to this site. Our visit here was worthwhile.",

The inside is air conditioned and there are a number of aircraft that are outside with no shelter so bring an umbrella and fan as its was hot in the sun. The little cafe on site is available for cold drinks too . When we arrived the gentleman at reception gave us an in-depth explanation to the history of the museum and when he found out my son is an RAF cadet then he talked a lot about how the pilots are trained and what the museum means to the TAF.\n\nOn the ay back we didn't have to pay for the BTS tickets , not sure if it was just luck or a perk of going to the museum , wither way we spent 2 hours there and really enjoyed it .

The museum is 30 years old now, thriving with the support from our socialist and unionist friends, AND cool visitors like you.\n\nTo everyone else, please do ring the bell when you're at the door and always check the opening hours on the Facebook page beforehand. Our staff are also activists who'd have to attend events elsewhere sometimes.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n- Chalit \"New\" Ratapana\nThai Labour Museum volunteer\nEmail: tlm.thailabourmuseum@gmail.com",

It may look closed when you arrive but ring the bell beside the front door.  Within a minute a helpful woman appeared to unlock the door for me and switch on the lights inside (yes, otherwise it is dark).  The museum consists of several small rooms followed by one larger one and it's probably logical to go round them clockwise in this way.  It's a charming old-fashioned mixture of all sorts of things laid out, of which everyone is likely to find something of interest.  I probably spent round about an hour looking round.",

                "text": "An excellent little museum about labour in Thailand from feudal times and slavery through the times of labour for wages with the arrival of Chinese coolies up to modern attempts to improve the condition of labourers and the lethal assaults on Thai workers and students by the Thai military such as in 1976 & 1992. Excellent historical exhibits touching on sensitive aspects of Thai history such as the Thai alliance with Japan in World War II and the death of so many labourers on the Thai-Burma railway. Outstanding exhibits on Thai cultural history.\n\nThe museum itself may seem old and low tech but then it relates to older, low tech times so that\u2019s okay.\n\nIt\u2019s at an obscure location beside the railway tracks near Makkasan Station \u2013 more than a 1 km walk from either Phetchaburi Station on MRT or Phayathai Station on BTS. There is an office in the back where the curators may be working and the reception desk may be unattended. There is a bell beside the door to ring to attract attention. Admission is free; there is a voluntary donation box by the reception desk.\n\nThere are wonderful sights to behold in Thailand where, as elsewhere, we can learn of the good works of monarchs and the ruling elite but don\u2019t find so much about the labourers who were supporting their efforts \u2013 this museum addresses the stories of some of those labourers.\n\nThe information in this museum is not easily found elsewhere and I rate this as a 5/5 attraction. There is information here about those sensitive periods in Thai history when news was suppressed and Thai people asked what was happening. Fascinating!",

Along the way it talks about the political changes in Thailand, efforts to suppress labor groups, and tragedies like the suppression of the 1973 uprising and the Kader toy factory fire.  Many displays are in English.\n\nBudget about an hour.  It's a tiny museum, seemingly run by labor organizers who are genuinely happy to have visitors.  No entry fee but donations welcomed.  \n\nThis museum is a 20 minute walk from the Erawan Shrine, not a very scenic walk but goes through an area with a lot of cheap restaurants.  It's also readily accessible from BTS Ratchaprarop and MRT Phetchaburi stations.",

                "text": "First things first: The place is NOT in Soi 62 as stated here on TA, but in Soi 58. Soi 62 is just a very short and dirty dead end alley with nothing to explore. And you can see that on the sign indicating the right Soi \u2013 It says \u201cSaphan Pla\u201d, with means Fish Bridge. I did not see any bridge though.\n\nSoi 58 is five to ten minutes walking from Saphan Taksin Sky Train Station. Just pass the temple named \u201cWat Yannawa\u201d \u2013 the one with the concrete boat \u2013 then the Bangkok Dock and you are almost there.\n\nIf you \u201csmell something fishy\u201d upon entering the Soi do not worry! Here it means that everything is fine and you have come to the right place. The whole street and the buildings smell like fish, even when the market is closed in the daytime. But it is not too bad, not like it\u2019s rotten, it is just\u2026fish. \n\nNote that this is not a tourist place. It is a wholesale market where the fisherman\u2019s catch from the night is traded to restaurant owners and fish factories. There are no fancy seafood restaurants anywhere nearby. There is actually nothing nearby that has to do with tourist places or fancy stuff at all.\n\nBut the good part is that here you can see and experience real Thai life and you are off the beaten path. If you were looking for places where no Farang \u2013 tourist or Bangkok resident \u2013 show up, well\u2026you\u2019ve found one!\n\nTo be honest, I missed most of the action. I went one day in the afternoon and the market was deserted. I took only some photos of the beautiful graffiti (all related to the ocean in general and fishing in particular) on a wall near the market building. \n\nThe next day I went at six o\u2019clock in the morning and even this was too late. Only three places still showed activity by working on or selling fish. I found out that the busiest time is between midnight and four o\u2019clock. The photo opportunities are seemingly endless, I\u2019ve been told. But remember: You are invading people\u2019s daily work space. It can be rough at times and you should ask for permission to take photos. In Thai the question is: \u201cTai roop dai mai?\u201d. I always got a positive response and a smile.\n\nFor the smell alone working with fish is not a dream job to have. Some people might feel uneasy when a tourist shuffles along and takes photos of them. Don\u2019t be too pushy and respect them!",

It is right outside the\u00a0Royal Thai Naval Academy BTS\u00a0station. The grounds have some planes and tanks, which make for an interesting pic, and they have a running track all around which I guess is for active naval personnel. \n\nInside there are several buildings and rooms you can explore. You get an informational pamphlet too which explains the different rooms. Some examples are the gun room \n\nIt\u2019s a little far out from the city center, but if you are going to be around that area then I think it\u2019s worth an hour of your time. \n\nWANT TO GO? \n\n95 Sukhumvit Rd, Pak Nam, Mueang Samut Prakan District, Samut Prakan 10270 \n\nThai Royal Naval Academy BTS station \n\n8.30-3.30 daily \n\nFREE ENTRY\n",

There was no one else in the museum when I was there, not even a guide to explain anything. For me it was OK. I was more interested in understanding the history rather than looking at the many artefacts. As the vast amount of text is not unsurprisingly in Thai, the interest somewhat waned. There are some interesting things to look at so if in the area it is worth a call in, don't make a special trip. Free admission.",

                "text": "I decided to do the Source\u2019s detox to-go program for 21 days in June this year after having amazing results with 14 days of the retreat program last year. Where to begin\u2026\n\nFirst up, the 14-day retreat program last year was truly powerful. I lost some weight and it helped with a skin issue I had, but it was the results after the program that had the most impact. I felt like I had a new mindset and started noticing lots of little synchronicities. For example, some new job opportunities essentially fell into my lap, I met some very interesting new people, and some small things I'd wanted for a long while seemed to just materialize in my life. It\u2019s difficult to explain, but it felt like there had been a change externally as well as internally.\n\nI\u2019d wanted to stay longer, but had to go back to work, so I decided to return this year and do the full 21 days to keep the positive momentum going and complete the change in myself (but as the detox to-go option, so I could still follow my regular routine).\n\nInitially, it was a little more difficult, and I felt I needed to increase the amount of juice I was drinking to match the energy I was spending on work and going to the gym. Ivor was on-hand to talk me through the process though and give me some recommendations.\u00a0\n\nAfter 21 days (and two liver flushes), I lost 8kg! And my skin issue had cleared completely. Even though the process was a little harder during the longer detox, I finished with a remarkable sense of peace and clarity. I was a bit worried I was too relaxed (!) and had lost my drive a little, but my motivation soon returned after I slowly reintroduced food. Apparently this calm feeling was related to clearing all the acid waste from the body, as it had become much more alkaline.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever fasted before, you know the detox clarity I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s not like your problems disappear, more that you aren\u2019t so worried about dealing with them, and are content to let things just unfold. I really feel like it has been the ultimate reset for my body, both physically and mentally. I\u2019m writing this just over a week later and it\u2019s like I have an entirely new perspective. Everything feels remarkably in flow. It\u2019s going to be exciting to see what changes happen in my life as a result.\n\nIf you can\u2019t do the retreat program, it\u2019s entirely doable to make the juice yourself at home or elsewhere on Koh Samui and go about life as normal with the detox to go (I did it in an Airbnb nearby and Ivor lent me a juicer!). I highly recommend doing the full 21 days if you can. It feels life changing!",

                "text": "I recently finished 7 days of the Source new advanced detox program and I can honestly say it is a game changer. What was most noticeable was the speed at which the change happens. Having done the normal 28 day program a few years ago, it was great and I felt good, but this new program works on a much deeper level and in a much shorter time frame. \n\n I felt it open up my energy on many levels in mind body and spirit and in a profound way for me. Maybe I was just ready for this change at this precise time. It has encouraged me to make more lasting changes to my health because I want to keep this feeling of being more alive into the future. As I might have drifted back to some not so healthy habits before, I have no desire to do so now. That\u2019s the big difference. The new feeling is too good.\n\n I did blood tests before and after the detox where there were a few issues with liver, kidneys and cholesterol numbers. The same blood tests after the detox were completely in the normal range and cholesterol came way down to the middle of the normal range. That\u2019s a big shift in a small time frame, a bit unbelievable really and my doctor was quite surprised. I lost 4 kilos in the 7 days and I am still continuing to lose weight several weeks after the detox. My total weight loss is at 5kgs. I did also notice that my eyesight improved and I had a lot more energy to exercise during the program which was new to me as normally on a detox I would have just rested all day. You could probably even work while doing this.\n\nI would say it\u2019s definitely an accelerated program, so if you don\u2019t want to detox for a long period of time, you can get excellent results rapidly and effectively, which has a lot of appeal if you don\u2019t have a lot of time. It\u2019s a game changer for detoxing.\n\n It\u2019s a more expensive program but worth every penny if you care about your health. I am planning on doing the 28 day new advanced program because if I can get these results in one week, what would 28 days be like? I\u2019m really interested to know. I already feel considerably younger after a week and much happier and more creative in my work.",

You take your shoes off and, upon entering, sit in a comfortable chair and receive a foot bath while soothing background music plays. Next you're escorted into the massage room.\n\nWe didn't like the temperature in the massage room. It was warm and stuffy and, on a 95-degree day, we needed cool. A fan on the wall was circulating at low speed, so I bumped it up a notch, which got the air moving.\n\nThe tables here have no face cradles, and none of the portable kind were provided for us. This makes lying on one's face very uncomfortable. Unlike the other two massage houses we visited, no clothing basket is provided here to store your clothes and personal items. I piled my clothes, purse, umbrella, and jewelry in a corner on the floor. \n\nHubby and I opted to have our massages in the same room, which was a mistake because the two employees doing our massages talked frequently. They wouldn't have been able to do that, had we chosen separate rooms. Talking during a massage is distracting and annoying. \n\nMy Thai massage was pretty thorough, although I experienced a better one a couple days ago. Herbal Steam charges 200 baht for a 1-hour Thai massage and 300 baht for a 1-hour oil massage. I paid 180 baht for the previous Thai massage. Not much difference in price at most places in the old city, except the luxury spas, which charge 2-3 times higher.\n\nThis was fine, but I wouldn't go back with so many other massage options in Chiang Mai.",

You can cycle all around in 20 minutes or so. Somewhat shaded, but bring a hat! The bird watching tower is good in theory, but if you think you're going to spot any birds with all of the human activity going on, slim chance unless you go early. There are snacks to buy at the entry, and tons of other food choices on the outside. Where they came up with the title \"Botanical Garden\" I'm not sure. This is NOT one of those. Come to Bang Kachao for the whole experience, just don't set your expectations too high for this park. ",

Mega Plaza in Bangkok, Thailand is by far the craziest collector toys/action figure hot spot I've seen in recent times! I mean, the smorgasbord of stores with all sorts of stuff on sale.....is just CRAZY!

We ended up buying quite a few Anime miniatures here at good prices, but some of the higher quality items were pretty expensive, especially the large model aircraft.\n\nA good place to visit if you are specifically looking for these types of things and have the patience to visit many stores to find exactly what you want.

It's supposed to be shrine for a famous monk and there is a giant statue of him with a seriously serene look on his face, There is also an artificial cave with coloured lighting that Thai kids would love. So you can see, I find the Buddhist side of things gimmicky or ordinary. However, the Khmer ruins are another story and well worth a visit.

                "text": "Wat Prasat is located on Intawaroot Rd across rom Wat Phra Singh, within the old city walls and was probably built at the end of the 16th cenutry. The temple complex has two chedis (pagodas). The ubosot, viharn and one chedi are constructed in a straight line.\n\nThe Lanna style viharn\nThe classic Lanna style viharn that was built in 1823 is a wooden structure, set on a stone base. It has a steep three tiered roof with chofah (a royal symbol representing the protector garuda) decorating the top ends. The panels on the entrance as well as the pillars are intricately decorated with carved flower motifs in Lanna style.\n\nThe stairs leading to the entrance of the viharn contain large Nagas (mythological snakes) guarding the building.A unique feature of this temple is the short tunnel that connects the viharn to the chedi behind it. Usually the viharns principal Buddha image is found towards the back of the wall opposite the entrance.\n\nAt the Wat Prasat the center of the back wall contains an ornately decorated entrance to a short tunnel that leads to the chedi directly behind it. The sitting Buddha image that can partly be seen from the viharn is actually inside the chedi.\n\nOn either side of the tunnel entrance a number of Buddha images are seated on pedestals about 1 meter high. One of the images is a bronze dating back to 1590, the others are stucco and of a more recent date. Part of the viharns walls are decorated with murals from the early 19th century.",

                "text": "Prasat Pueai Noi is claimed to be the biggest Khmer sanctuary in the upper Northeastern. It is believed to be built in the 16th-17th century to be a place to perform Hindu religious rituals. The sanctuary consists of 3 main buildings and a library surrounded by a moat representing Mount Sumeru. The place is still well preserved and the lintel depicting reclining Vishnu is still rich in detail. However, it is noticeable that it has been renovated. \n\t\nPrasat Pueai Noi has several good points. Firstly, it is easy to reach as it is located next to the main road. Secondly, in case that you are deep into Khmer sanctuaries (like me), it is a good starting point of your Khmer sanctuary trail in Thailand from Khonkaen down to Sakaew. You can just use it as a stopover as it is small so it doesn\u2019t take much time to look around. Finally, it is free of charge for both entr\u00e9e and parking. \n\t\nThe bad points of this place are as follows. The first one is that Pueai Noi is 1-hour drive from the heart of Khonkaen so if you are not actually interested in the sanctuary, it might not worth your time. (My house is 20-minute drive to the sanctuary, so I can use this place as a picnic site; it\u2019s perfect for me!). Another bad point of this place is that it is very small compared to other Khmer sanctuaries like ones in Phimai and Phanom Rung. They are a lot bigger and more beautiful. \n\t\nOverall, I don\u2019t recommend this place to foreign travelers who have limited time. It is better you visit the other two I have mentioned. Be that as it may, I proudly present this sanctuary to local travelers. If you ask me if I will visit this place again, my answer is \u2018DEFINITELY!\u2019. It actually depends on one\u2019s point of view to decide if this place is worth a visit. Anyways, I hope my review helps you guys decide whether to visit or not to visit.",
